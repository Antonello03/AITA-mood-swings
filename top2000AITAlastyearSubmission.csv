He's broke because his late wife got cancer. 3 times. He ran up 6 credit cards, 2^(nd) mortgage on the house, cashed out his retirement, everything and anything to get her the treatment she needed and then to get treatment enough to see both daughters married.

Year 1 Tim chastised them, they apologized (to him, not me) They blamed the pain of seeing their Dad with a woman who wasn't their Mum.  
Year 2, they did it again.  
  
This year I told Tim not again.  
He could go, I would never ask him not to see his daughters for Xmas but I'll stay here.

In the ensuing argument it came out that they assumed there had been a life insurance policy, nor did they have any idea about the credit card debt or the 2^(nd) mortgage that the house was underwater on or that Tim was looking at foreclosure and bankruptcy until he moved in with me.  
  
They did not realize it was my house, that he pays no bills save the water bill (man takes excessive showers) and shared groceries.  
  
Now the girls want my number. They are sorry I “felt lonely” at Xmas.

They want to come visit and stay with us next year! Conveniently in summer, I live near a beach.

I have a perfume collection that I started when I was a teenager slinging burritos as my first job. I have over 400 bottles at this point, I take great pride in my collection, and I use it. I’m also happy to give people decants (samples) of most of my bottles, let them sample a spray or two, give some bottles as gifts, etc. 

What I have a HUGE fucking issue with is my 17 year old niece coming into my home under the guise of walking my dog, decanting bottles on her own and SELLING THE SAMPLES to her little friends. She thinks that because I have so many bottles, I wouldn’t notice some missing or getting massive dents in them. Well little miss entrepreneur failed to realize that her “private” Instagram wasn’t “friends only” or whatever and I saw each and every fucking story with each price and sample she had.

I tallied that shit up and got a pretty good estimate based on cost per ounce. Thankfully she mostly picked the “Tiktok famous” perfumes like Bianco Latte and Escapade Gourmand and didn’t go for the most rare, niche perfumes. She did snatch an entire 2.5 oz bottle of Baccarat Rouge, though, which runs $300+ at most retailers, as well as full bottles of perfumes you can get at Sephora. Like Marc Jacobs Daisy, Burberry Her Elixir, Flowerbomb, etc. 

Petty or not, I printed out the entire list of what she’d taken, price estimate, and handed it off to my sister (her mom). I said that I expect to be paid back, in full. And of course her fucking sneaky little ass is never allowed in my home again. My sister got super pissy with me going on about how my niece is just a kid, kids make mistakes, etc. I said yes, kids make mistakes, and this is a GREAT way for my niece to learn from hers.

We have one child together and I was pregnant with our second. I’m western Canadian while he is from Germany. We lived in Canada for a long time, but because of inflation moving back to Germany seemed like a better option for us. We bought a nice house in Hannover where Peter is from. 

The day after our flights to Germany we all visited Peter’s family. This was the second time I have seen them (the first was at our wedding). They greeted us and brought us inside of the house, fussing over my son. We had dinner, and soon we left the house, wanting to settle into our new home. We visited Peter’s family often for the next few months. But I had started to realize that they would sometimes speak about me in German. They would make rude comments on my hair and makeup, question my fashion choices, and overall were just very unkind to me. They also said mean things about my pregnant belly which I was already insecure about.

I ended up talking to my husband about this. I told him that I didn’t like the way that they were treating me. I said that I hated how my every choice was judged. He told me that he would talk to his family. 

The next time that we went to his parents house, there were no more mean comments. For about three months it was like nothing ever happened. I gave birth to a perfect baby girl that we named Lilith. Peter’s family was very upset when they heard the name. If you didn’t know, Lilith means “ghost” or “of the night.” We didn’t pick this name because of its meaning, but because it is a name that every girl in my family has had for many years. My middle name is Lilith, along with my moms, my grandma’s, and even my great grandma's. 

For a while I didn’t visit my in-laws. I didn’t want to hear them talk about how I shouldn’t have named my daughter Lilith. But yesterday we saw them again. It was my mother-in-law’s birthday. As soon as we showed up things started to go badly. Everybody wanted to hold Lilith which made my MIL upset because people weren’t paying attention to her and made me overwhelmed. I didn’t want people holding her. I was going through a pretty bad postpartum depression and it was still pretty early to see people. I let people look at her, but declined when anyone asked to hold her.

During dinner I heard my SIL talking to my MIL in German. I heard her complaining about how she couldn’t hold my baby. My SIL even had the audacity to call me, and I quote, “a fat ugly hokey addict.” I turned to my SIL and MIL and told them off in German. I basically said that I have always known what they have said about me, but calling me names was the last straw. I also mentioned how I have known German for almost my whole life. The table instantly blew up. People were yelling at me because apparently this was all my fault. I left with Peter and we haven’t talked to them since. So AITH?

So my husband comes from a 'traditional' family. Mum's a SAHM, father was sole provider. I come from the opposite - my mother pretty much forbade from ever being financially dependent on a man and drilled that into me early on. 

My husband worked hard to unlearn the values he saw replicated at home. He (often more than) pulled his weight at home, was an engaged and present father and a genuine partner. The one thing that grinds my gears is how much weight he puts on the opinions of his family. I get that we all want our parents to be proud of us, but this is too much.

My ILs are staying with us for 2 weeks. Our usual MO is, I prep breakfast, we all eat lunch at work/school, and my husband makes dinner. We have a cleaner, but she's on holiday so in the meantime we're DIYing the cleaning where it's down to everyone to keep their space clean and common spaces we all clean. This is how we've always done it, and it works. 

My ILs hate that I'm 'one of those modern women'. They hate that I work, they hate that I don't find my purpose in being a wife and mother and they hate that my husband pulls his weight at home. We spoke pretty frankly early on, where I established my boundaries and told them I won't be chastised about how I live my life in my home. When I am a guest in their home, I accommodate their ways and play the DIL they wish I was. They have for the most part respected this. 

I got home yesterday after work tired and starving. I typically get home 1815/30 and we eat at 1900. I said quick hellos and ran up for a pre-dinner shower. When I came down, I went to the kitchen to help set up for dinner and found nothing ready. I asked my husband about it but he wouldn't look at me and his mother answered that he hadn't cooked anything. She told me I needed to do my duty as a wife and cook for my family. My coward of a husband still wasn't looking at me. I just walked away and ordered takeaway. I dished up for me and my kids and we sat at the table to eat. My husband and his parents served themselves and joined us. 

My MIL was still going on about what was wrong with me and why I was a failure. I asked my husband if he had anything to say. He said his mother had a point and it wouldn't hurt if I acted 'more like a proper woman' and 'took better care of my home and children'. He said tradition was tradition for a reason and it was kind of insulting that I thought I was too good for how he was raised. 

This is where I might be the asshole. I told him tradition won't allow a man on 35k to support a family of 5 and he was too broke to be so sexist. He looked hurt and I saw tears welling in his eyes. He excused himself from the table. I regret saying this in front of our children, but him saying that to me after I'm busting my ass to clean up his mess on top of having to deal with his parents was too much for me. AITA.

My brother and Hailey want an older/vintage name for their baby and Hailey asked me about 5 months ago why I disliked Evelyn enough to change the name. At the time she brought up how popular the name has become and how vintage is back. I told her I didn't like vintage names and to me it sounded really old fashioned. I told her the popularity didn't influence my decision. She wanted to know my reason for disliking older names and why I liked something like Indie instead. I didn't mind her asking this first time.

She brought it up again a week later and she asked the same question and pressed more for why. She asked a third and a fourth time. I gave her the same answer and asked her why she kept asking me. I told her my answer wasn't going to change. By the seventh time she asked she admitted she was worried her baby would hate having an older name and wanted to figure out what she could do to prevent what happened with me happening to her. She also said she'd like me to rethink my name because she thought Evelyn was beautiful and she was sad I had chosen something like Indie over it.

She told me I didn't really have a good reason to like the name and Indie seemed like the kind of name someone young likes but not someone older. Then yesterday happened and I kinda lost my temper. She started out asking the same stuff and the baby is almost ready to be born so I know it's coming to an end but she asked me to really think about why and help her because she couldn't figure out what she'd do differently than my parents did. Then she said they really shouldn't have let me change my name so young. I snapped and I told her to stop asking me the same question because my answer won't change and her comments are not changing my mind because I don't like old fashioned names. I told her I think they're awful and I'm sick and tired of hearing about how much better they are and having her try to make me find a reason she finds acceptable.

For some background, 2 people from the group, Susan and Greg, are just absolute leeches. Going out for lunch? Expect them to order the most expensive on the menu then feed you some sob story about their finances and then dumb half the bill on you.

Last weekend, Dan, one of the people from the group, told me about a casual dinner . I told him how if Susan or Greg were there I wouldn't be able to come. He tells me that they would be there but I should just put my opinions aside and come just once.

This is kind of where I might be an AH. I agreed with him and told him I would be there. I show up and we all get to talking.

Everyone began putting in their orders, most of them spent about $40. There were only about 6 people there. When it gets to Susan and Greg, they both order expensive dishes, around $200. When it was my turn to order, everyone looked at me, but I just pick up the menu and point to the $4 Miller Lite and sent the waiter away. Dan asked why I hadn't ordered anything and all I said was that I lost my appetite. The other 2 friends got up as well to cancel their orders and just have drinks.

After the main courses came out, I saw Susan and Greg picking at their food. The waiter then brings over the check. Greg then grabs the waiter and asks him to split the check 6 ways. I stand up and correct him saying the check was to be split 3 ways. Greg looks at me confused and asks why since we ""always"" split the bill. I reminded him that 3 of us had not eaten any food so we would just be paying for our drinks.  So basically at the end of the night, Dan, who probably only ate around $50 worth of food, was stuck with a $146.98 check at the end. (Yes, I remember the exact number.) I swear I saw his jaw drop when he picked that receipt up.

I slid a $10 towards the check, said goodbye everyone, and walked out.

The next morning, I found my phone full of texts from Greg and Susan telling me I was an AH for not ordering any food and forcing them to pay  more than they had accounted for. I honestly laughed because the steaks alone were more than what they had paid  but to each their own right?

I also got a lot of messages from Dan saying that I could have just not came instead of pulling that stunt and getting him stuck with an outrageous bill.

Edit: At this restaurant, the bar is separate so drinks are on a separate bill if that makes sense. And if anyone is concerned about leaving a tip, I live in Australia.

Edit 2: Hey guys just wanted to clarify some things:

1. 90% of restaurants where I live they don't do separate checks and might separate the bill for you if you're lucky. BTW. This post is in AUD, so if you want the amounts in USD, you have to convert it.
2. Dan could have easily asked Greg and Susan to transfer him the money if he wanted but he's always been about helping them through their ""financial hardship"" even though they're just using him and keeps dragging me into it. I admit what I did was immature but I'm tired of being forced to play along. It's his money and if he wants to spend it on them, that's fine, but I'm not paying for them.
3. Also Dan's a really good friend of mine, albeit blind AF. I was just trying to get him to see what kind of people he was ""helping"". I will admit it was a tad bit petty.

This is not what happened, and I said as much. What actually happened is that I wanted to be Snow White, and had told everyone, including the teachers, that I was going to be Snow White.

My mother decided that she wanted to be quirky and that Snow White was a bad role model after I got in trouble for trying to cook dinner for my family.

I (33f) work in a very small, technical, specific, male dominated field. I won't give too much information on it as I think you could easily find my identity if I did, but let's just say it's a sub category of law. 

I graduated 9 years ago (for anyone wondering, the system in my country is different than in the US so I only studied for 5 years), and am now a lawyer as well as a researcher. I published some work here and there but nothing too major, and no one outside of that field knows my work. 

Yesterday I went to a bar with a couple of friends who introduced me to one of their friends who works in the same field as me. I was pretty excited to meet him because it's rare to meet people who work in that field. He doesn't exactly do the same thing as I do, he's not a lawyer but a legal advisor, but we work on the same topics. So naturally we started talking about our work. 

At one point we were discussing a point on which we had different opinions, so I explained mine to him and he replied by saying that my opinion was based on nothing while his was based on the work of a professional (you guessed it, me). He basically started explaining my work to me, but in a completely wrong way and missed all of my points. I asked him if he was sure that that was what the author meant and he said that he was because it was ""pretty simple actually"". For another good 20 minutes he explained all of it to me in details, like I was a first year law student. I didn't say anything because it was pretty funny to watch him say things that were completely wrong with so much confidence. 

After that the topic changed and the night went on, but at the end of the night right before leaving I decided to tell him that I was actually the person that wrote the work he had quoted, and that he hadn't really understood it. He reacted very badly and got angry, and he told me that I had manipulated him to humiliate him. He yelled at me for not saying it was my work at the beginning. I simply replied that he had embarrassed himself and left. 

I woke up this morning to texts from my friends saying I was wrong for causing drama and tension and that I could've been nicer to their friend. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong there. I mean yes, I could've told him right away, but is it that big of a deal that I didn't? I'm not exactly sure. AITA? 

Edit: I forgot to make this clear and maybe it's a bit of a misunderstanding, but both conversations happened only between the two of us. We were the only ones talking about our work and our friends also weren't really there when I told him that I was the author. So it's not like I publicly humiliated him. The only thing ""embarrassing"" for him here is that a woman seemed smarter than him, and I think that's what ge had an issue with.

He has 2 kids 28-Madison and 26-Brett. Note I am not calling them my stepkids because they explicitly told me I am not their stepmom, just their dad's wife. I didnt play a part in raising them so Im ok with that. Its always been a tense between us, Ive tried my best to be kind to them and have been generous when I can be, but they are very cold with me. Being a child of divorce, I can partially relate to a parent moving on so I try not to force anything. 

Madison recently got engaged and we are excited about it. Everyone was over recently and she asked about a wedding budget from us and Rob told her he was able to contribute 10k. She has bigger hopes for her wedding than this so she was upset and kept asking for more. Rob however is still working hard on building his savings back up. Before his late wife died, he basically wiped out his cash savings, had to cash out his 401k, and even took a small mortgage on his house to cover medical costs as well as life expenses since he had to cut back on working. Eventually he had to drop that job for a more flexible but lower paying one, so this 10k is actually really generous from him.

Rob went to run an errand and it was just me and his kids. Madison then asked me if Im going to give any in addition to what her dad is giving. I told her were a marital unit and thats what we discussed together as a reasonable amount to contribute. She then said ""I should have known, obviously you married an older man for what he had, not for what you could give"". I knew she didnt like me but this is the most flat out rude thing she ever said. I kinda lost it and said ""excuse me, who do you think has been paying the second mortgage your dad took out to pay his debts?"" 

Truth of the matter is I make more than her father by a large margin, I have no debt, and have been paying 70% of the household bills the whole time we've been married. The 10k were giving her, is available because Ive been able to subsidize her father's living expenses the last few years.

Then she called her dad later and said that I told her that I blamed her mother for being sick for her not having a better wedding budget. I told him what happened and he was mad at her but also said I shouldnt have shared his financial details with his kids.","AITA for telling my husband's kids how broke he was when we met after they insinuated I was a golddigger? Ive 38F been married to my husband Rob 52M for 4 years now.  My husband's late wife died 1 year before we met and we dated for 2 years before marriage. He has 2 kids 28-Madison and 26-Brett. Note I am not calling them my stepkids because they explicitly told me I am not their stepmom, just their dad's wife. I didnt play a part in raising them so Im ok with that. Its always been a tense between us, Ive tried my best to be kind to them and have been generous when I can be, but they are very cold with me. Being a child of divorce, I can partially relate to a parent moving on so I try not to force anything. 

Madison recently got engaged and we are excited about it. Everyone was over recently and she asked about a wedding budget from us and Rob told her he was able to contribute 10k. She has bigger hopes for her wedding than this so she was upset and kept asking for more. Rob however is still working hard on building his savings back up. Before his late wife died, he basically wiped out his cash savings, had to cash out his 401k, and even took a small mortgage on his house to cover medical costs as well as life expenses since he had to cut back on working. Eventually he had to drop that job for a more flexible but lower paying one, so this 10k is actually really generous from him.

Rob went to run an errand and it was just me and his kids. Madison then asked me if Im going to give any in addition to what her dad is giving. I told her were a marital unit and thats what we discussed together as a reasonable amount to contribute. She then said ""I should have known, obviously you married an older man for what he had, not for what you could give"". I knew she didnt like me but this is the most flat out rude thing she ever said. I kinda lost it and said ""excuse me, who do you think has been paying the second mortgage your dad took out to pay his debts?"" 

Truth of the matter is I make more than her father by a large margin, I have no debt, and have been paying 70% of the household bills the whole time we've been married. The 10k were giving her, is available because Ive been able to subsidize her father's living expenses the last few years. I made it clear that not only am I not a golddigger, Im literally wealthier than my ""older husband"". She called me stuck up after this and stormed out.

I called my brother (39), his two children are adopted. He admitted a long time ago this was due to the high chance of disability in our family. He told me my delivery is rude, but they also suck, they should know not everyone wants kids. He encouraged me to apologize because I know how they are.

My foster parents told me I should ignore whenever someone calls me Nicholas now. Unless they're new and just assume. But I can ignore their family members who do it. So that's what I did. I've ignored them a handful of times now and it bothers them so much.

The other asked ""Nicholas"" to pass the potatoes at dinner and I kept eating and didn't pass anything. I was then called out for ignoring them and my foster parents said nobody knew who they were talking to because there was no Nicholas at the table. One of my foster sisters said she assumed it was her ""Nicole"" and they got confused and that's why she passed it instead.

I was told I should be more open to the wisdom others offer with name suggestions and stop being rude by ignoring people. Even though my foster parents backed me up again. It made me feel a way because this really is my best foster experience and I don't want to piss off people in my foster family.

They both had very different high school experiences. Kelly was very social and in different sports. Sara was very academic and had a small group of friends.

Kelly got a sport scholarship for college but soon dropped out of college after she failed multiple classes. She basically partied and did her sport and nothing else. Sara went on to finish her degree and is doing well in life.

Kelly has a jealously issue, and I have talked with her beofore about it. She is never happy when Sara has an accomplishment.

Today Sara told us that she is going on a cruise for her vacation this year. Kelly always wanted to go on a cruise and couldn't afford it with her waiter job.

In the car she blew up saying that Sara was a loser in highschool so it isn't fair that she has all this now. She went on for a bit when I had enough.

My sister, Amanda (28F) has a 4 yearold Jack. After a family BBQ last month, Amanda pulled me aside and said “Hey just so you know it might be better if you dont bring Ryan to the next few family gatherings”

I asked her why, and she got all awkward, saying “Jack’s been asking questions about you and Ryan, and I don’t think he’s old enough to understand all that yet”. I told her we weren’t exactly putting on a Pride parade in her yard. We were literally just eating hot dogs and chatting with family. She replied “It’s just confusing for him. You know how kids are

I was mad but kept it together and said “If Ryan isn’t welcome, maybe I just won’t come either” She sighed and said I was being “dramatic”

last week Amanda called me, panicked, because her babysitter canceled. I told her I couldn’t because Ryan and I already had plans. She begged, saying she was desperate, and I finally snapped “Why do you want me babysitting Jack? What if I accidentally expose him to my terrifying gay lifestyle? God forbid he sees me and Ryan together”

Amanda blew up. She accused me of using Jack to “make a point” and said “This isn’t about Ryan. It’s about you being spiteful. Youre punishing Jack cause youre mad at me”

She told my parents, and thats when real drama started. My mum called and said I was being selfish for letting a “small disagreement” ruin my relationship with Amanda. I told her it wasn’t small and reminded her of Amanda’s comment about “confusing” Jack. Mum brushed it off saying “She’s just doing what’s best for her child”

I said“What about what’s best for me? Why do I have to hide part of my life to make her comfortable?”

My dad sided with me. He said Amanda was being narrow minded and told her “Kids aren’t confused by love theyre confused by people acting like it’s something to hide”

Amanda then put the drama into the fam group chat. my uncle said “its not homophobic to want to protect your kid from topics theyre not ready for. Why push it? This set off my cousin She said “If Jacks old enough to understand that Amanda and Mike are married, then hes old enough to understand Uncle (Me) has a boyfriend” She accused Amanda of being a hypocrite and called out my uncle too, saying “Let’s not make this about your own outdated beliefs” she also called Amanda a “stuck up bitch” and my uncle called my cousin a “drama queen” my aunt chimed in on the family chat saying “I don’t agree with (Me) lifestyle, but we should still support each other” my grandmother replied “Support doesn’t mean tolerating disrespect.”

Amandas husband Mike texted me saying “Look I don’t have a issue with you or Ryan, but this is getting out of hand. Amandas just trying to avoid awkward questions from Jack, not insult you.” I told him, “Its already insulting. Would she say the same thing if I were dating a woman?” He left me on seen.

It's been almost a week, and they're both still upset. Even after I explained I never wanted that party in the first place, they're insisting I could have sucked it up for an hour, or at least cut the cake.

When I first joined, things were not doing well, so I (with others) worked our asses off to improve that, and we did.

I ran for president in the most recent election. I ran against five other candidates. Four of us had years of experience and had been preparing our campaign for months/years. One person (let’s call them Alex) was extremely new (a few weeks), had zero experience at all, decided to run at the last minute, and had a very large friend group with other new members. Alex was barely allowed to run due to how new they were, but made the cut by a handful of days. You can see where this is going.

It was extremely close between me and Alex, and I lost by one vote. The rest of the elected officials were all new members, of the same friend group, also without experience.

Then, it was discovered that 9-10 votes, specifically the votes of other people in leadership positions who worked closely with me, were not counted. This was not intentional or malicious, simply a computer error. 

Apparently every single one of them voted for me. I technically won. They tried to get the election results overturned because of it, but higher ups would not allow it, because they feared it would look like favoritism. At the end of the day, I was told to keep quiet and not let anyone know about this.

It's been rough for everyone but especially for her ofc. Our family rallied around her. Helping out as much as we can and I’ve been there every step of the way because I love her so much. But since the accident. it feels like I don't deserve to have any good things happen to me or at least I’m not allowed to talk about them. Every time something positive happens in my life I get shut down by my family. When I got a promotion at work last year I was so happy and excited to tell them. I thought my family would be happy for me but when I tried to share the news. My mom pulled me aside and told me to not now because my sister had a tough day. I ended up keeping it to myself.

8 months ago my boyfriend proposed. When I told them. My mom immediately changed the subject later telling me that my sister was feeling down about her own marriage struggles. It’s like anything good in my life is an offense to my sister’s situation.

This happened a few days ago. I’ve been saving up for years to buy my first new car. I finally managed to do it and I was so excited. I thought my family would be happy for me. So I decide to tell them. As soon as the words were out of my mouth the room went dead silent. My mom whispered to me ""This isn’t the time. think about your sister"" My sister looked so sad and I instantly felt like the worst person in the world.

I just couldn’t handle it anymore and I said ""Can't I share anything good in my life. I thought you’d all be happy for me"" no one knew what to say and I left the house. I’ve never done that before. Now I’m filled with regret and confusion. I love my sister and I never want to hurt her but it feels like I’m not allowed to have anything good happen to me. It’s getting to the point where I feel like I’m walking on eggshells all the time. I understand my sister’s life has changed drastically and I’m genuinely supportive and have always been there for her. But sometimes I just want to be able to share my own life too. I feel so guilty for even feeling this way like I’m being selfish or inconsiderate.

Her husband and even my parents share things about their lives freely and no one seems to mind. But as the younger sister I’m not allowed to share anything good in front of her so I don’t hurt her feelings. I get it. I really do. I understand she’s going through a lot and I don’t want to add to her pain. But it feels like I’m not allowed to have any joy in my life around my family.

Now I know I owe my sister an apology for how I reacted. I never want to make her feel sad but I’m struggling with how to approach my family. I don’t feel like I should apologize to them. And honestly I don’t think I’ll be sharing anything with them in the future.","AITAH for what I said? my family won’t let me share any good news because of my sister's disabilityI 26F have an older sister 32F who had a tragic accident three years ago that left her paralyzed from the waist down. It's been rough for everyone but especially for her ofc. Our family rallied around her. Helping out as much as we can and I’ve been there every step of the way because I love her so much. But since the accident. it feels like I don't deserve to have any good things happen to me or at least I’m not allowed to talk about them. Every time something positive happens in my life I get shut down by my family. When I got a promotion at work last year I was so happy and excited to tell them. I thought my family would be happy for me but when I tried to share the news. My mom pulled me aside and told me to not now because my sister had a tough day. I ended up keeping it to myself.

8 months ago my boyfriend proposed. When I told them. My mom immediately changed the subject later telling me that my sister was feeling down about her own marriage struggles. It’s like anything good in my life is an offense to my sister’s situation.

This happened a few days ago. I’ve been saving up for years to buy my first new car. I finally managed to do it and I was so excited. I thought my family would be happy for me. So I decide to tell them. As soon as the words were out of my mouth the room went dead silent. My mom whispered to me ""This isn’t the time. think about your sister"" My sister looked so sad and I instantly felt like the worst person in the world.

I just couldn’t handle it anymore and I said ""Can't I share anything good in my life. I thought you’d all be happy for me"" no one knew what to say and I left the house. I’ve never done that before. Now I’m filled with regret and confusion. I love my sister and I never want to hurt her but it feels like I’m not allowed to have anything good happen to me. It’s getting to the point where I feel like I’m walking on eggshells all the time. I understand my sister’s life has changed drastically and I’m genuinely supportive and have always been there for her. But sometimes I just want to be able to share my own life too. I feel so guilty for even feeling this way like I’m being selfish or inconsiderate.

Nope. 

My pizza stone was dirty, it is scorched not dirty, so her brilliant idea was to make the pizza on my plastic cutting board. 

Because that way she could just take the cutting board out with oven mitts and cut the pizza without having to use all the tools.

No flames, no heat. I get to the stove and turn it off. I open the sliding door to let out more smoke and get my leash on the way out. 

The firefighters are there within five minutes and the smoke is already dissipating. They go in to make sure. 

All clear. 

Thank god they were there less than an hour. It is covered by the city. If it was over an hour I would have been charged for the response.

Once it's ready you slide the paddle under the pizza and pull it out. Put it on the carving board and cut it. 

Easy right? 

Nope. 

My pizza stone was dirty, it is scorched not dirty, so her brilliant idea was to make the pizza on my plastic cutting board. 

Because that way she could just take the cutting board out with oven mitts and cut the pizza without having to use all the tools. 

I got home to see black smoke coming out of my house and my girlfriend on the phone with 911. 

My dog is not on his leash and he's going crazy. 

I go to the front door to see if it's hot in the house or if I can see flames.  

No flames, no heat. I get to the stove and turn it off. I open the sliding door to let out more smoke and get my leash on the way out. 

The firefighters are there within five minutes and the smoke is already dissipating. They go in to make sure. 

All clear. 

Thank god they were there less than an hour. It is covered by the city. If it was over an hour I would have been charged for the response. 

My oven is fucked though. And I have a lot of smoke damage to clean up. 

I told my girlfriend I was glad she was okay but that she is a dumbass and she wasn't allowed in my house alone for a while. I took her key away.  We do not live together. But she has roommates and likes having a big house to herself on her days off. 

She says that it's a mistake anyone could make and that I'm an asshole for calling her names. Yes she said those words. She says it's my fault for not just getting microwave pizza and having to eat fancy.

This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, and I’d been waiting months for it. I sacrificed a lot financially and mentally to make it happen. Since it was my first (and probably only) time seeing them, I went all out: I bought GA tickets and arrived at the queue at **5 a.m.** (even though the doors wouldn’t open until 6:30–7 p.m.) in freezing cold weather. I waited all day—hungry, cold, and dehydrated—but it was worth it because when the doors opened, I secured a **front-row barricade spot**, right up against the stage. This was my dream spot.

Then, a guy behind me tapped me on the shoulder and told me he was disabled. He said the venue was supposed to let disabled attendees in early, but they hadn’t. He asked me to give him my spot at the barricade. Here’s the thing: I know this venue is **very accommodating for disabled attendees**. I actually have friends with disabilities who’ve gone to shows here, and the staff always ensures they get to the front row safely during a designated time frame before it gets too crowded. 

Now, I’m a **very short person (155 cm/5’1”)**, and this guy was **extremely tall**—easily over 5.5 If I gave him my spot, I wouldn’t be able to see anything at all because he would completely block my view. I honestly would’ve been willing to move if he wasn’t so tall or if I could still see from the second row. However, in this case, I knew I’d lose the view I had waited more than 10 hours for.

I tried to compromise. I pointed out that the **right side of the barricade** was still open and suggested he go there. Since he’s so tall, he’d still have a great view and could hold onto the rail for support. However, he refused, saying the view wasn’t as good as where I was. While we were talking, that section filled up, and he became more insistent. He said he’d ""have a hard time"" if he couldn’t take my spot.

At this point, I got frustrated and explained:

1. If his disability was that serious, he should be in the **accessible section**, which is specifically designed for attendees with disabilities.
2. If he insisted on being in the standing section, he should’ve brought a support aid, like a cane (I’d seen someone nearby with one).
3. If he spoke to security, they could escort him to the **front-row disabled seating**, which has a fantastic view and is much more accommodating.

After hearing this, he called me an ""asshole,"" told me to ""get fucked,"" and left.

I feel like he just wanted my spot and wasn’t being truthful. The venue offers several options for disabled attendees, and I tried to direct him to alternatives. I feel bad for saying no but I don’t think it was fair for him to ask me to sacrifice my entire experience.

So, **AITA** ?

EDIT: Regarding the man’s height, after everyone pointed it out I've realized I indeed made a mistake. I don’t live in a country that uses the metric system and I should’ve double-checked my conversion instead of estimating from memory.

A has a fiancé who recently moved in with him. She's cool and I don't really have anything against her she just has her own group of friends and doesn't have the same interests as us or 'click' for a lack of a better word with her husband's friends (us). She recently has been trying to get more into A's interests so she has been there for our games. She doesn't play with us, just kind of watches and plays on her phone, which is fine of course.



A has a table he set up specifically for the game, one with a recessed middle so we don't have to put away our stuff at the end he just puts a leaf over the top to protect it. Because of that in order to move around your character you have to lean forward or stand to be able to reach. Now I have big boobs.

And yes, before you ask I have already started the process of getting a reduction and I cannot wait to have this weight off of me! 



The problem is that when I lean forward to move my character my breasts squish against the side of the table and after awhile it gets uncomfortable and painful. So I've taken to lifting up a little and settling with my breasts sitting on the edge of the table. It doesn't push them up or call attention to them, to be honest I don't even think it's noticeable. With the height of the chairs I can still sit normally with them there and lean forward without it hurting my boobs. I've been doing this for months and no one has said anything. But last week A's fiancé snapped out of no where and accused me of trying to ""put myself on display and to put my boobs away cause no one cares"". I was shocked and didn't know what she was talking about at first, neither did anyone else until she pointed at my boobs and called attention to what I was doing.



She got really really upset and caused a scene and we ended the night early. She's still mad at me and doesn't want me to come over to the house anymore. I've apologized and said I'd try not to do it anymore and even told her how I'm going to get it reduced next year. She called me a ""show off and slut"" and is asking A to stop being friends with me. I'm at a loss. I do this all the time, I've even caught myself doing it at home with my own table without even thinking about it. AITA?","AITA for always putting my boobs on the table?So basically my group of friends (about 8 total) get together every week for D&D. There are only two woman in our group (including myself).  It's always at friend A's house because he's the DM and has his fancy table and his whole set up there. A has a fiancé who recently moved in with him. She's cool and I don't really have anything against her she just has her own group of friends and doesn't have the same interests as us or 'click' for a lack of a better word with her husband's friends (us). She recently has been trying to get more into A's interests so she has been there for our games. She doesn't play with us, just kind of watches and plays on her phone, which is fine of course.



A has a table he set up specifically for the game, one with a recessed middle so we don't have to put away our stuff at the end he just puts a leaf over the top to protect it. Because of that in order to move around your character you have to lean forward or stand to be able to reach. Now I have big boobs. I'm not a particularly big woman, I'm like in my late 20s, 5' 4'' and 155ish pounds with H-cup breasts.

Unfortunately, my car will not carry a mobility scooter, so my cousin will be required to use a wheel chair.  The problem is that this event is being held in a public park.

I tried contacting a couple rental agencies in the area but they would not lease scooters in this case because of the off-road use.  My aunt and uncle have also declined to loan me their truck, which is how my cousin normally gets around, because I have a pretty shitty driving history.

I did look into renting a vehicle that could carry the scooter, but my cousin cannot afford to pay for that and obviously with me being jobless, I can't either.

The distance from parking to the event area is about forty-yards, which my cousin cannot handle walking.  About the best solution anyone's come up with is that the party has a flat bed they're using to tote supplies from the cars, but my cousin says she would feel humiliated having to be rolled in like that.

My cousin is furious with me, saying I'm shaming her by saying I cannot push her, but I feel it's the honest truth.

Back in 2008 when I started University, I rented a 2 bedroom apartment with my (exex)girlfriend at the time and my friend & his girlfriend.  
We got a great deal for it, as the owner of the place lost his job because of everything that happened back then and decided to try her luck abroad where she still lives.

Years went by and after University my friend and his GF decided to find a place of their own, as we had full-time jobs, renting this apartment together did not seem expensive anymore, and also did not seem expensive to rent alone after we broke up some time later.

So there I was, alone in a 2-bedroom apartment in the central part of the city.  
The owner decided that she was too lazy to mess with bills and stuff every month and made arrangements for me to pay everything directly, as I earned her trust, I still pay her monthly rent which is very cheap for today and deal with everything else having her authorization.

Because of the perfect location, my second bedroom was basically ""free BNB"" for my friends who did not live in the city and I did not mind, it is good to have company if you live alone.

In 2020 I met a girl who was in a rush to get married and as I was madly in love we did in 2021.  
For some reason, I never told her the story of how I rented the place or that it was a rental at all, it just never came up! I have been so used to the fact that I am an authorized representative with building cooperative things etc, that I refer to it as my place.  
  
Our relationship started to cool down and we found out that we were not perfect for each other after all, so divorce it is.

So we did the paperwork for divorce and she is moving out.  
A few days ago I received an email from her with a real estate valuation document as an attachment - while I was not at home she wasted 500€ for someone to evaluate an apartment that does not belong to us... and wrote that I probably have to take a loan to pay her the 50% of that.  
I replied to her, didn't I ever tell her that this place is a rental? Why does she even assume that I can afford a 2-bedroom apartment in the city centre? She knows where I work and how much I earn.

She called and screamed at me, that I had lied to her for years and hid the fact that the apartment was rental! Then she tells me that well, she will take the car as we got that together!  
And I was quiet for a moment and then told her: ""You do know that is a lease right? The owner of the car is the bank!""  
Then she demanded that I pay for the valuation and I replied ""I did not ask you to do it!""  
She called me an asshole and ended the call.

Of course, she told our whole friends group how I ""lied to her during the whole marriage"" and there was a discussion in a messenger group with friends that if is it a lie or not, whether was it an asshole thing to do, some agree with me and some with her.

He had a basic understanding of the surgery but the only hang up he had was having to wear nothing but a hospital gown. No socks or underwear. When we got to the hospital room to get him prepped, he told his mom/my ex and her sister/his aunt to turn or to leave when he had to undress. Obviously he was fine with my being there and needed help.

After the surgery, me, my ex,her sister, her 13yo niece and my 18yo son were in the recovery room. He were waiting for Loren to sober up and get discharged. He started to come to and whispered to me that he wanted to put clothes on because wasn't comfortable wearing nothing but a gown in front of three girls.

At that same time, a female nurse came in to get his vitals and was talking to my ex. I asked if they could all step outside so I could help Loren get dressed. They looked bewildered at my request. The nurse then said she'd help me dress him because my son was still a bit weak. I said no thanks. My teen son will help out. 

She asked if I was serious by asking her to leave over this and I said yes. My son doesn't feel comfortable getting dressed in front of four females. The nurse said she's been a nurse for years and has heard of anything crass. I said you're comfortable, my son isn't and your being insensitive is what's crass and clueless. My said I was being dramatic. They left and me and my other son got him dressed.

My ex called me and said that I owe her and everyone else an apology. I refused. I said if the roles were reversed then you'd have a very different opinion. Also Loren has to take a bath for the next few days and she was crazy if she was expecting Loren to let her wash him or even be in the bathroom with him. It's different with me or his brother or friends and I don't have to convince her for me to be right. 

Edit: For the record, the gown he was wearing was made out of paper. It wasn't even cloth. My son was dying to get out of it. He was basically naked.

I don't think my son would had minded a male nurse at all but since me and my older son was there the thought of requesting a male nurse didn't cross my mind.

I don't know if they had a male nurse available at that moment because the nurse made a comment that they were short staffed but all qualified. I wasn't going to argue with her over who got to put on my son's Minecraft underwear or zipped his hoodie. It's a waste of my time. She did mention how she didn't want him to get hurt with my dressing him and I said then you best let me handle it because he'll fight you.

Update: I did have to take him back to the hospital this morning because he couldn't pee but had to. He was in a lot of pain.

At the hospital, I àsked if a nurse was going to see my son before or after his male doctor and they said yes. I asked for a male and they said they'd ask the head nurse. She asked why it was so important to have a male nurse. I told her we can schedule an appointment to fight over it after my son sees the doctor.

They did find a male nurse and my son was totally relaxed around him. The male nurse said a lot of female nurses take it personal when patients ask for a male nurse and it's always been that way. 

Fortunately my son didn't need a catheter and is fine.

I wore a YELLOW dress. Think like Belle in Beauty of the beast yellow. Bumble bee yellow. So yellow that I did not question if it was appropriate or not to wear to a wedding and neither did my friends nor family. 

I arrive at the wedding, we have the ceremony, the cocktail hour, the dinner and the reception. I get many compliments on the dress and the bride even comments on how much she loves it several times. 

Towards the end of the reception the venue dimmed the lights and turned on some blacklights. These blacklights made my dress appear more white than yellow. 

A member of the wedding party approached me while the blacklights were on and stated that I needed to leave because my dress was “white” and “inappropriate.” I stated that the dress was yellow but the blacklights were making it appear white. The member of the wedding party stated that if i didn’t leave she would “make me.” I stated I’m here to celebrate my friend, repeated that the dress was yellow and said I will not be leaving early (bride and groom hadn’t left yet and I came from overseas). The conversation while heated, did not have raised voices or foul language from either side. But I will say it was tense. 

The wedding party member walked off and I watched as they immediately went to talk to the groom, angrily pointing in my direction. The groom shrugged and continued to dance.

The next morning I was approached by a different friend at breakfast (not in the wedding party) who stated that they heard what happened and that I should have left when asked because it made people “uncomfortable” and that I made it about me “partying” rather than “respecting wedding etiquette.”

I have felt incredibly embarrassed about this since….so am I the asshole for not leaving the wedding when asked? 

TLDR: Wore yellow dress that looked white under black lights. Was asked to leave by a member of the wedding party. Didn’t leave. Told I made others uncomfortable by a friend the next day.

Also the most controversial things seems to be the black light dance party at this wedding. It was the last hour or so and was just a way to have fun. It was not as weird or as tacky as people are making it out to be. ","AITA for refusing to leave a wedding because I wore a dress that looks white under a black light?A few months ago I attended a close friend’s wedding with my husband. I wore a YELLOW dress. Think like Belle in Beauty of the beast yellow. Bumble bee yellow. So yellow that I did not question if it was appropriate or not to wear to a wedding and neither did my friends nor family. 

I arrive at the wedding, we have the ceremony, the cocktail hour, the dinner and the reception. I get many compliments on the dress and the bride even comments on how much she loves it several times. 

Towards the end of the reception the venue dimmed the lights and turned on some blacklights. These blacklights made my dress appear more white than yellow. 

A member of the wedding party approached me while the blacklights were on and stated that I needed to leave because my dress was “white” and “inappropriate.” I stated that the dress was yellow but the blacklights were making it appear white. The member of the wedding party stated that if i didn’t leave she would “make me.” I stated I’m here to celebrate my friend, repeated that the dress was yellow and said I will not be leaving early (bride and groom hadn’t left yet and I came from overseas). The conversation while heated, did not have raised voices or foul language from either side. But I will say it was tense. 

The wedding party member walked off and I watched as they immediately went to talk to the groom, angrily pointing in my direction. The groom shrugged and continued to dance.

The next morning I was approached by a different friend at breakfast (not in the wedding party) who stated that they heard what happened and that I should have left when asked because it made people “uncomfortable” and that I made it about me “partying” rather than “respecting wedding etiquette.”

I have felt incredibly embarrassed about this since….so am I the asshole for not leaving the wedding when asked? 

TLDR: Wore yellow dress that looked white under black lights. Was asked to leave by a member of the wedding party. Didn’t leave. Told I made others uncomfortable by a friend the next day.

We met at a job  in my mid 20s and were pretty regular company up until the pandemic, where our hanging out (including a circle of mutual friends) has taken a decline but isn’t extinct.

John and his partner \[let’s call her\] Jane (36F) have been together for about 8 years now, engaged for a little under 2 years, both with a child from previous relationships, so they have taken trips with their kids near-yearly, and I’ve been happy to help visit John’s (now their) home and check on things, take care of their animals, etc while they're gone.  I’ve helped them out with other projects/tasks over the years and most recently picked up Jane from the airport returning from a work-trip and got her home this past winter during a snowstorm because my vehicle could handle it.   Generally, I have been present and helpful on top of our base friendship.

About 5 weeks ago, I find out from a mutual friend their wedding is coming up, and invites went out a while ago, everyone in our circle but me invited. As a gay guy, I’ve experienced being iced-out of some of my straight friends’ lives and events in ways minor and pronounced, but this one has definitely been something that has had me thinking about my time and energy with people.  I decided I would take the hint and begin to distance myself.

Three days ago, John texts me asking if I am around in early-to-mid August.  I say I am.  John asks if I wouldn’t mind visiting like I have before to look after the animals and property, I said “sorry, I can’t.”  He calls to talk about it.  We run through the same conversation, polite but a bit tense, so I finally say “I just won’t be visiting your home.”  After a moment of silence, I bring up that I’m disappointed that I appear to be the only person in our group of friends not invited to his wedding, and that I can't be helping like I have before if I’m just a background friend at this point.  I wrap up the call positively and sincerely with me wishing them a good wedding and trip, and that maybe we can grab drinks soon.

Jane reaches out two days ago sending follow up texts saying John is upset about what I said and with her because she made the final calls about friend invites, and that I am taking this the wrong way, there is only so much capacity and that the others in our friend group have partners that took up space. She adds that she hopes I’ll change my mind and help out them out because it would put John’s mind at ease.

I’m not entitled to the company of others or invitations to anybody’s events, but am I wrong for setting my own boundaries in response to theirs?  I try not to frame my friendships as transactional, but they obviously want something out of me here despite their not inviting me and then avoiding even bringing it up with me until they needed help with covering their honeymoon.

As I’m unable to hold a full time job I don’t have heaps of money coming in so Ubers are usually a last resort. 

yesterday I had asked my dad if he could pick me up as the bus I was supposed to take never came. When he went to pick me up he made a few comments saying it would be a lot easier if I could drive, and how I should learn to drive anyways despite that fact that doctors don’t want me to as he hates having to pick me up all the time.  
I replied that it’s just what happens when you have a disabled child and it’s something you have to put up with. 

He took massive offence to that and told mum who thought I was being incredibly rude. 

He picks me up once or twice a week at most.

I am 29 and she is 26. We’ve lived together for 6 months. I have been very busy at work and with life so yesterday I was really looking forward to cooking dinner for gf and I and relaxing. We had this planned all weekend. My gf is more of a social butterfly than I am so she had plans yesterday morning with her friends. She had brunch at 11 and I was planning on having dinner ready by 630. I expected her to have a few mimosas at breakfast but nothing too crazy. Maybe she’d get home and take a nappy nap before dinner. 

Basically brunch turned into going to one more bar after (around 1 PM). Whichhhh turned into more bars. Which basically became bar hopping all day. She was texting me insisting that she will be home in time for dinner but by the way she was talking I could tell she was drunk. I started making the pasta around 5 pm. Around 530 I saw on her snap story that she was doing shots at a bar in a completely different neighborhood of Chicago. I didn’t want to be the boyfriend who nags so I let it go. I was getting seriously annoyed because I was thinking ohhh great she’s gonna be hammered for our nice night we had planned. 

At 630 she was not home yet. I saw on her location that she was now at a *different* bar from where they were taking shots at. I ate and asked my friends if they wanted to play PlayStation so I packed up the food, put it in the fridge and hopped on PlayStation with the boys. 

Gf arrived home around 715 PM clearly drunk. She asked wtf I was doing and what about dinner. I said she was late, and dinner was done but it’s In the fridge so she can heat some up if she wants. She apologized for being a little bit late but basically gave me a half assed laughing apology saying “you never know what to expect when the girl gang goes to brunch” I said that’s fine but I now have other plans. She called me rude and went to bed. We haven’t talked much about it today but I can tell she is being passive aggressive so am I the asshole?

Edit: oh and she also went and said my dinner didn’t look very good so she door dashed Taco Bell 

UPDATE: gf and I talked. We are okay for the most part. She did sincerely apologize and admitted to her fucking up. She said she wished I came when she invited me though after she learned it might be out longer than like 2 PM. 

This started another issue or think we need to figure out in our relationship. She opened up and said she wished sometimes I was more outgoing and social.

She’s picked up a new (and problematic) issue since she was last home for an extended period of time, surrounding laundry.

Basically, she has established a “boundary” where nobody is to touch her clothes. Her reasoning is that she’s concerned something will go missing/get damaged, thinks it’s just gross for us to go through her stuff, and is an adult who deserves privacy. All fine, we have 3 young children in our home (9f, 9f and 2m) so plenty of washing to keep us entertained.

The issue is that she has a habit of monopolising washing facilities to the extent where we’re effectively prevented from being able to get any other laundry done. For example, last weekend she put a wash in before work and hung it out on the line at around 11am. She then left for work (12pm-10pm) - her wash was dry within an hour, and obviously she wasn’t going to be back all day. We had a few days worth of washing to get through, so my wife (her mum) took everything off the line and folded it. We got through 5 other loads that day.

She was NOT happy when she got home, and said that she’d been very clear that we weren’t to touch her things. When we explained the situation above, she said it was “first come, first served” (not something we’ve ever said) and that since the next day was due to be nice also, we should’ve just waited to get through it the next day. That really pissed us off.

We’ve offered her a weekly laundry day, where we’ll avoid using the machines so she can have freedom to do as she pleases on that day, but she said once a week won’t cut it. Fair enough, but there are 5 other people in the house that need clean clothes/bedding/towels. Other than that all we can really suggest is that she keeps on top of her washing. If she’s at home we’ll ask her to clear her clothes from the machine/dryer/washing line as needed, but like any 19 year old she has a social life/work commitments and is often busy.

She’s upset because she says we’re not respecting her boundaries, whereas we’ve pointed out that while “don’t move my clothes” is objectively reasonable, it’s not fair for her to do so at the inconvenience of everyone else in our home. Essentially the last conversation we had ended up with her in tears because we said as long as situations like Saturday keep occurring, we’ll continue to move her stuff. Just FYI, we do fold her clothes carefully, and leave them in a basket in a communal living area so they’re kept together, in good condition, and we’re not going in and out of her room.

We normally have a good relationship with her, so this is all a bit unusual. We’ve asked her if everything else is okay, and she says yes and seems otherwise normal in and of herself, and she’s normally reasonable so - are we being unreasonable?

EDIT: So the consensus is pretty much that we’re right, and our daughter is being massively unreasonable, and that we’re being pushovers for not being tougher on her from the off. We‘ve shown her the comments, and unfortunately she’s still insisting that we’re the unreasonable ones.

We’d never considered the local laundromat, and have banned her from using our washing machine for the next fortnight given she’s still unwilling to adjust. She‘a absolutely FURIOUS, and wife has ordered a lock for the washroom door to enforce the 2 week rule. Hopefully a couple of weeks hauling her stuff to and from will help her see the light. Thanks very much all!!

  
EDIT 2: A slightly calmer update this morning. Our daughter came to talk to us, and apologised for the situation. She said she had found the transition back home hard (I get that) and had maybe become a bit territorial over her stuff while at uni. All okay. She then asked if she could please have a laundry day, and be allowed to use the machine. Her place of work is closed Mondays, so that’s now “her” day, and we’ve said that she can use the machine on other days - but if by 7am Tuesday there’s anything in the way (or any issues on any other days!) we’ll be moving her stuff. A genuine sorry goes a long way with us, and while the advice has been to hold firm, we don’t really want an issue if the situation can be resolved calmly. We’ve also made it clear that if her things DO have to be moved on any day (other than Monday which is totally hers) and we get ANY grief about it, we’ll go back to a 2 week ban and there’s no going back. 

Maybe a less satisfying update than the last one, but we’re happy we can resolve the problem calmly.

I'm (17m) the oldest. My dad was estranged from his dad since he was my age. His mom died when he was 10. So we never knew grandma either. My dad was open about the fact grandpa wasn't a very nice man and all kinds of stuff. But he never went into details. I know he really did a number on dad because I still sometimes see dad look ashamed if he spills something or makes a mistake. I also know he tries to hold back any time he cries and looks downright disgusted with himself for crying.

Three years ago his dad reached out and my mom and my sister (15) were SO excited and basically welcomed him into the family. Dad said no way. He and mom fought a lot about it. My siblings all told dad they had a right to know our grandfather and he should love his dad.

I was dragged along at first and I stopped going. Dad has refused to have any part in it and he and mom fought because he told her his father was never going to step foot inside our house and if he did, then dad would leave and he would never come back. So mom takes my siblings to see him.

Christmas was a huge fucking fight last year because they decided to spend it with this dude and my dad refused to go and so did I. My siblings started crying into dad's face that they wanted Christmas with him. Mom was calling him selfish. She tried to do the whole ""I'm your mother and you listen to me"" and dad told her he's my father and I could stay with him if I wanted to.

They're still sour about it but then dad took me out for his birthday and didn't come home until late because he found out they were planning to take him out to meet with his father. My dad told my mom and my siblings since he cannot trust them with his birthday, he will only celebrate with the people he can trust now. I also heard him tell mom this couldn't continue and they needed to divorce.

Now my mom is freaking out because she doesn't want the divorce and my siblings are really upset. They told me I should help since dad and I are still close. I told them they should learn to live with the consequences of their decisions. I pointed out to mom she was always big on us learning. I told them this is a big one. My mom told me my siblings are so young and don't deserve this. I told her it's all her fault because she undermined dad by making a point to demand he come in front of my siblings and so they think they can manipulate him and not listen.

AITA?","AITA for telling my mom and siblings they should learn to live with the consequences of their decisions?So my family is my dad, mom, my two sisters and my two brothers. I'm (17m) the oldest. My dad was estranged from his dad since he was my age. His mom died when he was 10. So we never knew grandma either. My dad was open about the fact grandpa wasn't a very nice man and all kinds of stuff. But he never went into details. I know he really did a number on dad because I still sometimes see dad look ashamed if he spills something or makes a mistake. I also know he tries to hold back any time he cries and looks downright disgusted with himself for crying.

Three years ago his dad reached out and my mom and my sister (15) were SO excited and basically welcomed him into the family. Dad said no way. He and mom fought a lot about it. My siblings all told dad they had a right to know our grandfather and he should love his dad.

I was dragged along at first and I stopped going. Dad has refused to have any part in it and he and mom fought because he told her his father was never going to step foot inside our house and if he did, then dad would leave and he would never come back. So mom takes my siblings to see him.

Christmas was a huge fucking fight last year because they decided to spend it with this dude and my dad refused to go and so did I. My siblings started crying into dad's face that they wanted Christmas with him. Mom was calling him selfish. She tried to do the whole ""I'm your mother and you listen to me"" and dad told her he's my father and I could stay with him if I wanted to.

They're still sour about it but then dad took me out for his birthday and didn't come home until late because he found out they were planning to take him out to meet with his father.

I guess they thought geographical names were cool but I think there’s a huge difference between calling your child Arizona or Dakota or Paris Vs Pennsylvania. They’re massive republicans and America lovers so maybe they wanted to be patriotic. 

For as long as I can remember, everyone has called me Penn or Penny. My parents insisted that everyone was to call me by my full name but most people could see how ridiculous my parents are. 

My sister (28F) didn’t struggle as much with her name since Arizona just sounds better than Pennsylvania, and the Greys anatomy character Arizona Robbins made the name seem quite cool as we got older. I was mocked and teased as a child in elementary school because of my parents insistence on my full name. They would literally berate my teachers for letting me write ‘Penny’ on my work/books.

When I was 21, I got my name legally changed to Penelope. Most people I had met in college had assumed that I went by Penny as a nickname for Penelope, even my boyfriend’s mother called me Penelope because I was too embarrassed to tell her that Penny was short for Pennsylvania. I kept it a secret from my parents and close family because I knew my parents would go mental and accuse me of disrespecting their choice.

I’m getting married this summer to my lovely boyfriend Tom (31M) and as you all know, you have to say your full name in your wedding ceremony when doing your vows. I knew I had to fess up about the name change because the alternative would be hoping they kept quiet when they heard me say ‘I, Penelope’ instead of ‘I, Pennsylvania’.

I invited them over to my home and I tried to tell them in a really calm way that I had changed my name but they freaked out. They said that I was disrespectful, I was calling their choice dumb etc. They are refusing to attend the wedding now.


I know i’m not the AH for changing my name, but my parents are particularly pissed about how I kept it hidden for five years before telling them. Most people I know agree with them. They think that I should’ve had the courage to be honest with them years ago so they would’ve had time to get used to it instead of me dropping the news on them two months before my wedding and causing all this drama. A few other family members have dropped out and my poor sister (who is maid of honor) is having a nightmare with this. My parents believe they had the right to know much earlier.

I was his Senior in Highsc, and we stayed together until a few months ago when he passed away due bone cancer.

I live in a traditional country where same sex marriage is no legal but is not a big issue socially. His parents kicked him out when he came out as gay at 17, my family took him in, helped him to finish HS and were supportive the most they could.

I work in HR and he worked in IT, since he started to work he made good money. He saved enough to purchase a house 10yrs ago, he was paying the mortgage all by himself. 4yrs ago he got the diagnosis. He reduced his working hours to take care of his health and I stepped in to pay the mortgage.

It was a hard battle, but cancer took him back in March. After he passed away, his family appeared in the picture, saying how they regretted not being in his son's life and stuff. Time went by and a month ago they reached out to me asking me when they can expect I could give them the keys of the house. Since same-sex marriage is no legal, they ""could"" claim the house as their family.

I told them that the house was in my name, I ""bought"" it from him a year into the cancer, so it was legally mine and I had been paying the mortgage way before it. They got upset and said I was being unreasonable, that it should be legally theirs, that my **BF would have wanted to give them the house**, which is in fact true, my bf talked a lot how he would give everything to them if that would fix the relationship between them. Actually, he bought the house as a way to bring them live with him so they would no longer rent; he also tried to make amends with them all this time, unsuccessfully.

I told them that I would give them the house for the price I bought it from my BF and they would have to pay me back these 4 years of mortgage + take the debt over their name. They said they didn't have the money and that it was so selfish of me to tell them that, knowing what my BF would have wanted. They proposed just to change the debt onto their name and give me no money in return, I declined. They got mad and the discussion got heated to the point they told me they would bring me to court accusing me of scamming my BF to have the house (they can’t).

They have been calling and texting me non-stop for the past month, telling me I would be an asshole to my bf if I don't give them the house. I know they can't pay me back all the money I put in the house, but I'm conflicted right now. Some friends told me that I should give them the house and move on with my life, but it just doesn't feel right to me. I'm leaning more onto not giving them the house, but I know my BF would jump the bed and give it to them. Right now their words feels empty and as if they just want to take advantage of the situation. I don't need the house, to be honest, but don't want to give them either.

We never talked with my bf what should I do with the house after his death, so WIBTA if I don't give them the house?

I showed him the box. I told him to keep his money. He just had to give me a sealed box like the one he stole. 

He said he didn't steal anything. He took the box and went to the Lego store nearby. 

When he came back he was apologetic. He said he would get it back from my nephew. I said I wanted a sealed box with the Tie Fighter helmet. I even went on eBay to help him find one cheaper than he had found by himself at the collectibles store the guy at the Lego store sent him to. With shipping it would only be $300. He ordered it. He isn't happy about it. 

My mom is upset that I'm expecting that much money for a toy. My dad is upset that I didn't explain before he went and made a fool of himself at the store. I'm upset that they stole from me.

My dad got angry. He pulled out $70 and told me I was an asshole for making a fuss over a toy. I asked him if that was a down payment? He said that is what he spent on the last Lego gift he got me for Christmas and that is what those helmets cost. 

I showed him the box. I told him to keep his money. He just had to give me a sealed box like the one he stole. 

He said he didn't steal anything. He took the box and went to the Lego store nearby. 

When he came back he was apologetic. He said he would get it back from my nephew. I said I wanted a sealed box with the Tie Fighter helmet. I even went on eBay to help him find one cheaper than he had found by himself at the collectibles store the guy at the Lego store sent him to. With shipping it would only be $300. He ordered it. He isn't happy about it. 

My mom is upset that I'm expecting that much money for a toy. My dad is upset that I didn't explain before he went and made a fool of himself at the store. I'm upset that they stole from me.

But my sister (her aunt) looked at her with a shocked expression and said ""Another plate?"". My daughter turned around and gave a somewhat un comfortable look.

My daughter is 16, and has 2 part time jobs to pay for some of her college tuition, so she usually doesn't eat until 7-8pm. So I didn't even blink twice when she got up to grab her 3rd plate.

I turned to my sister and said she's been working all day without anything to eat, you made tons of food, it won't hurt for her to get another plate. My sister started yelling saying something about how it wasn't my place to say if my daughter could get more of her food that she made. Now I do somewhat agree with that, and might be the A-hole because of that. Looking back I'm thinking maybe I should have asked? 

My daughter ended up not getting another plate, and the vibe was awkward now so we just decided to go. Before we left out the door my sister stopped me and told me I should've taught my daughter manners and how it isn't right to get more than 1 plate at someone else's house.

Celebrating Father's Day or my birthday, I don't like attention on me and prefer to keep things low key whenever I can.

So, keeping that in mind, I was diagnosed with an extremely curable type of skin cancer. It was caught very early on and I never felt scared for my life in any way, shape or form. I'm an engineer and I think analytically and wasn't scared with a diagnosis with a 0.03% fatality rate. Still, I told my wife of course, and she was terrified. We talked through it and told her my doctor was very optimistic and said we have caught it early on, etc. None of it seemed to help, but I tried. After a while, I told her that we shouldn't tell our kids, 5F and 7F. My wife wanted to tell them, but I was adamant about that, I'm not even sure they would understand what we're talking about. Reluctantly, she agreed not to.

About a week later, I get a call from my dad.....asking about my cancer. Turns out, my wife posted on FB about my cancer that morning. I called her and wasn't happy that she posted my business and his behind the ""You didn't say I couldn't post it, just not to tell the kids"" excuse. There is no way she would think I wanted that posted online, no matter what I said. So, she took it down and time went by.

Very quickly, I was in remission with my skin cancer and my doctor told me, word for word, ""We don't like to say you're 'cured', but, you're cured"". I told my wife and she was ecstatic. She told me she was worried all this time (I could tell) and glad we put this all behind us. I thought we could put this all behind us too....

This weekend, I'm coming home on Friday. I see a lot of cars parked on the street, some in my driveway. I couldn't think of any birthdays or anniversaries I missed, but went in anyway...... It was a party for my remission diagnosis. I was mortified at this, she's never done anything like this and we've talked about how I would hate a surprise party multiple times. I asked what this is for a said ""I'm sorry, but I didn't know you planned this, I'm just coming back for some files and heading back to work"". It was a lie, I gathered up some meaningless files in my office and said thanks to everyone for coming and left to go back to my office, messing around on my phone until everyone left.

My wife knew I was lying and we fought that night and I told her I don't know what's gotten into her, but she knows I would never want this and she doesn't get to make a big deal out of something personal I never wanted to be public in the first place. We've been cold this whole week and my brother said I'm TA since I told him I just pretended to go to work.

So, AITA for not wanting to celebrate beating my cancer?","AITA for leaving my party for beating cancer?I (35M) am a very private person, I have no social media, don't want my wife (32F) posting photos of me, although I don't tell her not to, just don't ask her to post me. Celebrating Father's Day or my birthday, I don't like attention on me and prefer to keep things low key whenever I can.

So, keeping that in mind, I was diagnosed with an extremely curable type of skin cancer. It was caught very early on and I never felt scared for my life in any way, shape or form. I'm an engineer and I think analytically and wasn't scared with a diagnosis with a 0.03% fatality rate. Still, I told my wife of course, and she was terrified. We talked through it and told her my doctor was very optimistic and said we have caught it early on, etc. None of it seemed to help, but I tried. After a while, I told her that we shouldn't tell our kids, 5F and 7F. My wife wanted to tell them, but I was adamant about that, I'm not even sure they would understand what we're talking about. Reluctantly, she agreed not to.

About a week later, I get a call from my dad.....asking about my cancer. Turns out, my wife posted on FB about my cancer that morning. I called her and wasn't happy that she posted my business and his behind the ""You didn't say I couldn't post it, just not to tell the kids"" excuse. There is no way she would think I wanted that posted online, no matter what I said. So, she took it down and time went by.

Very quickly, I was in remission with my skin cancer and my doctor told me, word for word, ""We don't like to say you're 'cured', but, you're cured"". I told my wife and she was ecstatic. She told me she was worried all this time (I could tell) and glad we put this all behind us. I thought we could put this all behind us too....

I'll try to keep it short.

My wife and I have three boys, 17, 16, and 14. May the lord have mercy on my soul. Actually they are good guys.

I was at Target with my youngest, Tanner. We split for a while and he shows back up asking if he could buy something with his own money. It was a beard trimmer. I laughed and told him he didn't need that yet. He explained nope, not for his face, he wanted it for downstairs.  His older brothers both manscape and he wanted to as well. But they wouldn't loan their trimmers.

I told him sure, I'd even buy it for him.

Got home and wife was not impressed. She didn't want him to have it. One excuse after the other. ***He's not old enough.*** Sure he is. ***He didn't need it yet.*** Ok true he's not exactly taming a jungle, more like a small hedge, but if he wants to neaten things up that's fine by me. ***I don't want more hair all over their bathroom.*** Non-issue. The boys keep their bathroom clean. While me, Tanner, and the oldest Liam are pretty smooth, middle boy Lucas somehow got the gorilla gene (he was Sasquatch at 14). If he's not causing a problem, no one will.

I told him he could keep the trimmer but wife seems pursed. I did remind him to keep the bathroom free of little hairs... get brothers to help/advise if needed, or me... and don't make the mistake of going all Kojak below the belt, Liam made that mistake a couple of years ago. With much itching.

So AITA for disregarding my wife's opinion?

  
UPDATE --

Thanks everyone. I'm overwhelmed by all the comments, I only expected a few views/responses.  I appreciate all who commented. I read them all even if I could not reply back to each.'

All's good here. Last night I talked with my wife, as many theorized she is just wistful that the last baby bird is growing up (although all are still in the nest). She knows none of them will be little boys forever but she was (and is) such a good ""boy mom"" that she's missing those times already... and had a not-so-great reaction. That's ALL there is to it. Thankfully.

As for Tanner, I went up to the oldest's room where all three were hanging out (you never know where the posse of hooligans will be). Tanner said ""Check it out!"" stood up and dropped his shorts in a flash.. and yep, the hedge clippers had been at work. I told him great job, looks good. He said ""Liam had to do most of it."" Liam shrugged.  I'm very blessed that they all get along so well and that the older two are excellent big brothers (MOST of the time).

To a couple of ppl who DM'ed me, no none of us are nudists or anything like that LOL but they are definitely those never-wear-shirts guys, and when getting ready to go out you never know which one or ONES will be in the shower. The guys are just self assured (maybe too much), and not a shy bone in their bodies. Years ago TWICE my oldest (who had long hair then) went as Tarzan for Halloween. And my middle boy once went to a neighborhood costume contest as Michael Phelps in nothing but a Speedo and eight gold medals around his neck (and this was years after Phelps won). 

They keep me young and make me very tired at the same time.

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with scoliosis, & initially, surgery wasn’t needed. However, my condition got worse, & I was finally scheduled for surgery on 11/20 of this year. I told my dad about it months ago, expressing how much I needed his support this time, & he promised he’d be there. But later, he texted to say he’d planned a vacation that would keep him away until mid-December, just as my recovery period would be ending. It broke my heart, but I accepted it.

Then, 2 hurricanes hit his vacation spot, & he told me he’d make my surgery. I felt a glimmer of hope. But then, just a week before my surgery, he texted again saying his fiancée’s lung cancer surgery had been scheduled for the same day, a few hours before mine, at a hospital 30 minutes away. He said he “might not” make it to my surgery, but with him, “might not” usually means “won’t.” He added that this wasn’t about who he loved more. That message shattered me. I realized that no matter how much I hoped, he might never give me the attention & support I needed. I broke down on my kitchen floor that day.

After sitting with my feelings, I texted him to tell him how deeply his actions hurt me. I said it wasn’t only about love but about showing care, & that he’d given me hope only to let me down again. I questioned if his fiancée’s surgery had really been scheduled last minute, or if he had known earlier but hadn’t told me. I asked him to show he was my dad through his actions, not just his words. He responded, insisting the surgery was only scheduled the day he’d told me. But because he’s lied in the past to save face, I reached out to someone who might know the truth.

I then sent a follow-up message, clarifying that my frustration wasn’t with his fiancée; it was with his ongoing absence & lack of support. I said that even if his reasons were genuine, he could have at least shown some empathy. I told him I hoped he’d be a better father for my half-sister than he has been for me. In a final message, I made it clear that I was done putting in all the effort to maintain our relationship on my own. I told him that if he wanted to be my dad, I would gladly be his daughter, but if he chose not to, I would be fine with that too.

I've not been on good terms with his parents (Amongst other things, they asked me not to apply for child maintenance etc., as their boy cannot afford it, and so on, so you could say we're not the best of friends). 

Here's where the problem started- they recently found out about quite a few concerts I'm planning to go to- yes I'd posted about it on SM, but they have no access to my accounts, I don't know how exactly they found that info). Recently, during child drop off, my ex's mother got very upset about the concert mumbo-jumbo and started telling me off for making my ex pay child support I just waste on myself and so on. I couldn't hold it in and just started laughing, which aggravated her even more.

When she stopped ranting, and I stopped giggling, I told her, that her son's child support wouldn't even cover the travel cost of the trip, and they can rest assured that I don't live off of his child support given, that I wouldn't be able to raise my child on that amount, let alone the both of us. I should've stopped there, but I also added that so far we've received approximately £10/month \[note: I said that without doing the math, truthfully it's £11.09 LOL), which doesn't even cover the cost of fruit my child eats, so neither of them has any say in how I spend MY own money (Note: I'm not sure if it matters, but yes, I work full time, so I spend my earnt money). She called me a liar and stormed off.

Now their whole family are upset with me, saying that I was rude and they expect apologies. I was also told that I was an asshole for telling them how much I actually receive as it's put my ex in a bad light.

My friends are divided too- some found the situation hilarious and others say that while it was fair to stand up for myself, I shouldn't have told her how much I get in ChM. In my defence- I had no idea it was such a big secret, I genuinely assumed she just didn't care about the amount, and just focused on the idea of me getting any money from them).

Also, it's worth noting: My child didn't witness this interaction, she was already indoors, I'm sure it would've gone differently (I would've stopped the rant sooner) with the kid present.

She called me a liar and stormed off.

Now their whole family are upset with me, saying that I was rude and they expect apologies. I was also told that I was an asshole for telling them how much I actually receive as it's put my ex in a bad light.

My friends are divided too- some found the situation hilarious and others say that while it was fair to stand up for myself, I shouldn't have told her how much I get in ChM. In my defence- I had no idea it was such a big secret, I genuinely assumed she just didn't care about the amount, and just focused on the idea of me getting any money from them).

Also, it's worth noting: My child didn't witness this interaction, she was already indoors, I'm sure it would've gone differently (I would've stopped the rant sooner) with the kid present.

I paid for the bridal shower, bachelorette party (a weekend trip), decorations, and other expenses, spending several thousand dollars. While it was a lot of money for my husband and me, I wanted to make her big day perfect because she’s like family to me.

She said it was “tacky” to ask for the money back and that expenses like these were “my responsibility as MOH.” I reminded her that she removed me from that role, so those expenses were no longer mine.

Since then, Claire, her fiancé, and even her family have been spamming me with calls and texts. They’re accusing me of being petty and overreacting because of “pregnancy hormones.” They’re also saying I should’ve just let it go and written off the money because weddings are stressful, and Claire didn’t mean to hurt me.

My husband has been incredibly supportive and says I did the right thing. He’s furious at how Claire treated me and agrees that I shouldn’t be out thousands of dollars for a wedding I’m not part of.

We've been in contact and building a relationship for the last few years. So much therapy. So far, we've kept this all away from our kids. At this point, it's been a few years, and there's interest in having everyone meet. 

Thing is, between my wife and Laurel, they've come to an 'agreement' to tell the kids and everyone else in the family that Laurel is a family friend. Absolutely not. I'm sick of the lying. What they call each other is their own deal and I don't expect that to change, but I'm not lying anymore. I don't like lying to my kids as a policy, but lying to them about who's related to them and who isn't is dangerous.

I only want them meeting if we can tell them the truth. Now I'm getting into it with my wife, Laurel, and my parents (the only outside people who know). They say I should go along with it not for my wife's sake but for Laurel's. I understand why she would want that, but I don't think I care anymore.

I (34m) have been taking care of my sister's (32f) daughter for around 6 years. This all started when my sister got arrested for felony theft and drug charges. She's been a longtime addict, poor mouther, and family manipulator. No one else in my family stepped up, so I offered to take my niece in while my sister did drug treatment to avoid jail. From the beginning, my niece, then around 10, didn't want anything to do with her mom. I thought that was odd; but over the first few months I had her, my niece opened up about her mom having treated her very poorly. I sought a guardianship for my niece, and told my sister that I would not willingly send my niece back to her unless my sister got off the drugs and sorted her life out.

My sister initiated a legal fight with me to terminate the guardianship. I grew to love this kid like my own, and I didn't want to send her back to a bad environment. It cost me six figures over the course of a year-and-a-half in legal fees. I won. I managed to marshal substantial evidence of my sister's ongoing substance abuse and the court relied upon the report of a court-appointed guardian ad litem who reported favorably about my niece in my care and about my niece's negative view of her mother.

At some point in the legal process--as I was shelling out five-figure monthly legal bills--I learned that, as my niece's guardian, I was entitled to child support, so I filed the forms to seek it, and won it.

The state oversees the support award, and is apparently pretty thorough in seeking it. Garnishing paychecks and bank accounts. Now--years on--I am starting to get pressure from other family to forgive the child support. I have family reaching out to me saying my sister is doing better and just can't get ahead having to give up portions of her paycheck every month. With back amounts, it's like 30k in back support that I am owed. I don't need it, really, if I'm being honest. I make a good living--better than anyone else in my family has done.  
  
In all likelihood, sister's debt it will never be paid in full. But I don't want to let it go.

Relatives have been huffy at that response.  
  
My sister initiated a fight with me knowing full well she was back on drugs, and lied about it, and got caught in open court.

We only just recently reconnected after not speaking for 4 years. Now, every time she calls she asks me what I’m doing for the day or at that moment, and then invites herself, her family of 4, and some of her friends over to my house.

Example 1 for clarity: Friday was her spouse’s birthday. Monday she told me her plan was to take him to dinner. Then she calls me Friday morning asking me what I was doing. I told her I was just watching a movie on my couch. Then she says I know it’s last minute, but I want to come over and BBQ at your house. She said the kids could play together and we could hang out and have some drinks. I hesitated initially, and then told her that I didn’t really have a lot of meat here nor was my home “company ready.” She responded that she would grab some more food and do all of the cooking.

The rest of the celebration, I was trying to act normal, but he noticed and when everyone left, he asked if I was ok. I said I was never going to bake him something. His answer was, thank you and that I was being unfair with him because I should have already know.

She has organized her own birthday parties, excelled at debate team and the Feminist Roundtable club at her school where she organized a fundraiser for at-risk young women… I’m beyond proud of her. She is an incredible person and I truly feel the sky is the limit for her.

However, she has recently made a friend group who I believe is not great for her. Three people, two are non-binary and one girl, and all of them claim to be autistic. I guess this has rubbed off on my daughter because now she is also claiming to be autistic. My sister is following her on TikTok and I guess she posts “stimming” videos and other things. She has given me zero evidence before this point to even entertain the notion that she is autistic. I truly never even considered it until she met these friends. This leads me to believe it is made up.

I have noticed that these friends are causing her to distance herself from her other friends that encouraged a more healthy lifestyle - friends she met in feminist roundtable for example who I really liked. She does not really do anything anymore but sit in her room and make videos with these friends about autism. It’s really strange and has me feeling pretty bad.

The other day her and her friends were in the kitchen and my daughter said something along the lines of “she wouldn’t understand because she isn’t autistic” about a classmate. I calmly stated after she said this that she is not autistic either, has self diagnosed, and shouldn’t patronize people by claiming that she is autistic as it is inappropriate to people who actually struggle. She got furious and stomped up to her room. Her friends followed. She’s not talking to me anymore.

I, 25 f, am the oldest of 4 kids. Brother, Sam 20 m, and sisters (Maddy, 17 f) and (Kiara, 12 f). I have been going to Renfair since I was 16, usually with friends but once Sam and Maddy were 13, I started taking them with me. Kiara just turned 12 a few months ago and said she wanted to go to Renfair this year. I was hesitant but asked our mom and once she gave the ok, I actually got excited because (very sad about this) Sam is in the marines and can't go this year because he is deployed. That is, I was excited until I found out what she wanted to wear.

Maddy and I have been planning and making our outfits since last Renfair (we are both avid seamstresses) and offered to help Kiara design her outfit. Kiara is really into Furries lately and has started making suits and masks but I made it clear that Renfair isn't the place for that and I was uncomfortable taking her in that. She agreed, we came up with a few outfit designs, and set a day to go shopping for all the stuff.

She then came to me a week ago, gloating, saying that our mom said yes to her wearing a furry suit to Renfair.

Second, This is isn't a big renfair where you see all kinds of costumes. We live in a small town and aside from some tourists, it's mainly just people in our town.

I, 25 f, am the oldest of 4 kids. Brother, Sam 20 m, and sisters (Maddy, 17 f) and (Kiara, 12 f). I have been going to Renfair since I was 16, usually with friends but once Sam and Maddy were 13, I started taking them with me. Kiara just turned 12 a few months ago and said she wanted to go to Renfair this year. I was hesitant but asked our mom and once she gave the ok, I actually got excited because (very sad about this) Sam is in the marines and can't go this year because he is deployed. That is, I was excited until I found out what she wanted to wear.

Maddy and I have been planning and making our outfits since last Renfair (we are both avid seamstresses) and offered to help Kiara design her outfit. Kiara is really into Furries lately and has started making suits and masks but I made it clear that Renfair isn't the place for that and I was uncomfortable taking her in that. She agreed, we came up with a few outfit designs, and set a day to go shopping for all the stuff.

She then came to me a week ago, gloating, saying that our mom said yes to her wearing a furry suit to Renfair. I told her she absolutely could, but again, I wouldn't be the one taking her if she chose to wear that. She got upset and said I was being unfair because I was still taking Maddy. I told her again that Renfair isn't the place, and who I take with me is up to me. She's now very upset with me and is trying to get our mom to make me take her wearing her furry suit.

My parents time and attention has to be focused on him more than on me. For the first few years after he was born I spent a lot of time with my grandpa who raised me from the age of 2 until I was about 7 and then I was seen as ""old enough"" to be at home after school and could make my own food and clean up after myself and not need supervision mostly. Grandpa was willing, and had offered, to keep taking me after school but my parents said he didn't need to do it and he deserved to live his life.

I never get 1:1 time with my parents. They couldn't afford field trips and never took the time to apply for the school field trip fund so grandpa picked up the slack there. He paid into my school lunch account so I didn't have to make my own lunch. Grandpa was the person who'd pick me up from school if I was sick. He'd stay and take care of me at home since whichever parent would be home would really just say to go to bed or lay on the couch and relax and there was no caring for me or taking care of sick little me.

Their mom found it and threw it away.

-Why won't my mom take them in? She lives in a retirement community that doesn't allow anyone under the age of 65. I'm not sure if temporary stays are ok, but if she let them live with her then she runs the risk of getting evicted.

-I don't know how much damage was done to the bra itself. Thea's room was pretty trashed. We're talking clothes left on the floor, spilled perfume, and messing with a display shelf full of some of her old Disney dolls. 

-All I know is that Judy saw the boys messing with the bra, thought it was another kind of breast binder, and threw it away. 

-We got locks installed for Thea's room, along with our son and my husband's ""man cave"" after we found out the boys messed with his stuff.

Before he was born there was a lot of talk about names from different family members on both sides, but the pressure to tell was on my side specifically. We didn't tell a soul what the name would be until our son was born and we had left the hospital. My parents were disappointed when we announced our sons name.

My family are very traditional in how they named us. We were each named after grandparents and that's how they feel everyone should name their kids. My wife's family don't have a tradition when it comes to naming babies. They just name them and go. No fuss or insisting on certain names. But my wife's side tends to favor more uncommon and unusual names. 

My wife's and my taste tends to lean a lot more to her side than to mine. Which is how we ended up choosing the name Hollis for our son. This was not something my parents liked because they expected our son to be either Jack (my dad) or Parker (my FIL). But I know they were expecting a little Jack to be born. So that added to their reaction. But they quizzed us on our choice to ""break tradition"" and I told them it wasn't a tradition my wife's family used and we decided we weren't going to have one either.

Over the last couple of months both parents have questioned why, have wanted to discuss other names for future babies. My mom has been the worst by far. She asked why we went with something so unlike the names we have in our family. I told her our family wasn't the only family involved, but that we also didn't take the family tastes into account. We went with what we liked. She pointed out our taste were a lot like my ILs and I said yes, but that it wasn't about my ILs and their taste, it was about my wife's and my taste. I told her I was done discussing it and since that point I now change the topic or end the conversation when she brings it up or refuses to let it go.

We had a little naming ceremony on Saturday and my mom decided she was going to dig in her heels about the name and she told me we'd picked a stupid name and she hated it, she wanted us to change it and name him Jack or Parker. She told me we had no business breaking a long held tradition in our family and there's a reason those traditions are there so foolish people can't name their babies the worst names imaginable. She also said my ILs must be so smug thinking they'll have at least two stupidly named grandkids like they had all stupidly named kids. I lost my temper. I told her to shut up and accept that we're not naming our kids like she and dad named me and my siblings and I told her she would need to leave and learn to be more respectful because I would not take those insults against my wife or her family lying down. My mom hated being told to shut up and she said I had no excuse for rudeness to her face. I thought she was crazy when she was rude.

AITA though?","AITA for telling my mom to shut up and accept that my wife and I aren't naming our kids the way she and dad named me and my siblings?My wife and I (both late 20s) had our first child together in June. Before he was born there was a lot of talk about names from different family members on both sides, but the pressure to tell was on my side specifically. We didn't tell a soul what the name would be until our son was born and we had left the hospital. My parents were disappointed when we announced our sons name.

My family are very traditional in how they named us. We were each named after grandparents and that's how they feel everyone should name their kids. My wife's family don't have a tradition when it comes to naming babies. They just name them and go. No fuss or insisting on certain names. But my wife's side tends to favor more uncommon and unusual names. 

My wife's and my taste tends to lean a lot more to her side than to mine. Which is how we ended up choosing the name Hollis for our son. This was not something my parents liked because they expected our son to be either Jack (my dad) or Parker (my FIL). But I know they were expecting a little Jack to be born. So that added to their reaction. But they quizzed us on our choice to ""break tradition"" and I told them it wasn't a tradition my wife's family used and we decided we weren't going to have one either.

Over the last couple of months both parents have questioned why, have wanted to discuss other names for future babies. My mom has been the worst by far. She asked why we went with something so unlike the names we have in our family. I told her our family wasn't the only family involved, but that we also didn't take the family tastes into account. We went with what we liked. She pointed out our taste were a lot like my ILs and I said yes, but that it wasn't about my ILs and their taste, it was about my wife's and my taste. I told her I was done discussing it and since that point I now change the topic or end the conversation when she brings it up or refuses to let it go.

It’s a small event, with my parents, me, my brothers family and my SILs family attending. We avoid family quarrels by implementing a strict “no politics” rule and trying our best to be civil. I should probably mention that we are not a particularly close-knit family. We rarely see each other beyond these events since my Brother lives in South Africa and I travel a lot due to my work. Thanksgiving is important to my mom since it’s one of the rare times we’re all together.

Anyway, the main problem I have with my mother is her constant critique of me. She has a habit of making passive-aggressive comments about my life choices, from my career to my lack of children to the way I dress. I’ve addressed this with her multiple times, but she doesn't really seem aware of it. My father claims it is just her way of fussing and expressing that she cares. It does hurt though, because my brother is never criticised in the same manner. I cannot entirely fault her for her criticism, since I did majorly mess up my life a few months ago (depression) and it has affected her opinion of me negatively. It does not excuse the way I acted, but I just wanted to explain why I left. By the time we finished dinner, I was a bit prickly because of some of her commentary. 

I made a cake for dessert. I was explicitly put in charge of it and no one specified what exactly I should make, so I opted for Maple Cheesecake. I did my best and I think it looked okay. Mum normally makes pumpkin pie, but I really hate pumpkins (they make me gag), so I thought perhaps we could try something new. As I was bringing out the cheesecake, my mom eyed it somewhat warily and announced that she’d decided to make the usual pie as well. This caught me off guard. I asked why she didn’t tell me beforehand, and she said something like, ""Well, we figured you’d do your own thing, so I thought it was best to have a backup."" She went on to cut the pie and serve it to everyone, instructing me to leave the cheesecake in the kitchen. When someone asked to try my dessert, she said ""lets not mix too many flavors at once,"" which just felt passive-aggressive. I know it's immature for an adult  to get this upset over a triviality, but I just (politely) refused as she was handing me a slice of pie, retrieved my coat and left. People were calling after me I think, but by that point I was crying for some reason and it would have been too humiliating to have an emotional outburst in front of everyone for no real reason. 

My mom just texted me saying that it was incredibly rude and immature of me to leave like that, especially on Thanksgiving. My brother also sent me a message saying Im acting irrationally. I feel horrible for leaving so abruptly, especially because my parents are getting older and we are already not close. Something about my mother seems to turn me into a neurotic teenager and I hate it.","AITA for leaving in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner because of pumpkin pie?

She has a habit of making passive-aggressive comments about my life choices, from my career to my lack of children to the way I dress. I’ve addressed this with her multiple times, but she doesn't really seem aware of it. My father claims it is just her way of fussing and expressing that she cares. It does hurt though, because my brother is never criticised in the same manner. I cannot entirely fault her for her criticism, since I did majorly mess up my life a few months ago (depression) and it has affected her opinion of me negatively. It does not excuse the way I acted, but I just wanted to explain why I left. By the time we finished dinner, I was a bit prickly because of some of her commentary. 

I made a cake for dessert. I was explicitly put in charge of it and no one specified what exactly I should make, so I opted for Maple Cheesecake. I did my best and I think it looked okay. Mum normally makes pumpkin pie, but I really hate pumpkins (they make me gag), so I thought perhaps we could try something new. As I was bringing out the cheesecake, my mom eyed it somewhat warily and announced that she’d decided to make the usual pie as well. This caught me off guard. I asked why she didn’t tell me beforehand, and she said something like, ""Well, we figured you’d do your own thing, so I thought it was best to have a backup."" She went on to cut the pie and serve it to everyone, instructing me to leave the cheesecake in the kitchen. When someone asked to try my dessert, she said ""lets not mix too many flavors at once,"" which just felt passive-aggressive. I know it's immature for an adult  to get this upset over a triviality, but I just (politely) refused as she was handing me a slice of pie, retrieved my coat and left. People were calling after me I think, but by that point I was crying for some reason and it would have been too humiliating to have an emotional outburst in front of everyone for no real reason. 

My mom just texted me saying that it was incredibly rude and immature of me to leave like that, especially on Thanksgiving. My brother also sent me a message saying Im acting irrationally. I feel horrible for leaving so abruptly, especially because my parents are getting older and we are already not close. Something about my mother seems to turn me into a neurotic teenager and I hate it.",False,False,AmItheAsshole,AITA for leaving in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner because of pumpkin pie? ,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h2qz62/aita_for_leaving_in_the_middle_of_thanksgiving/

My wife's younger brother (Joe) and his GF are moving into an apartment together at the beginning of June.  But GF's lease is up at the end of April so she needed to move out of her place.  But Joe currently lives in a studio apartment so he doesn't have room for all her stuff.  So they were going to move all of GF's stuff into a storage unit for a month until they get their new place together.

A little over a month ago Joe had asked my wife if we would be able to help them move GF's stuff and she agreed.  My MIL was supposed to watch our son so we could both help, but she fell ill and had to cancel.  My wife suggested trying to get a babysitter for that day but I didn't want to spend hundreds on a babysitter to help someone move, that's dumb.  And bringing a 4-year-old with us would not be helpful to anyone.  

This turned into an argument between us because she said I should help them move while she watches our son since I'm stronger than she is and I know how to drive our truck with a trailer.  I told her that she should help them and have them rent a U-Haul for the day.  We ""compromised"" by telling Joe that I would help them but they need to get a U-Haul instead of using our truck and trailer. 

Then, the morning of the move (this past Saturday), my wife told me that a friend of hers got suite tickets through work to a hockey game for that day and invited them.  Yes, suite tickets to a playoff hockey game.  She said she would be bringing our son since her friend was bringing her kids too.  

Great, so not only do I get stuck helping someone move, but my wife and son get to go have an amazing experience together that I miss out on.  And yes, this was my son's first major sporting event and I was missing it.  

And wouldn't you know it, Joe never got a U-Haul.  And his GF wasn't even close to packed up and ready when I got there.  I spent 7-8 hours and multiple trips back and forth helping them move.  All the while my wife is sending pictures to our family group chat of how much fun they're having at the hockey game.  

When everyone was home that night, my wife was surprised that I wasn't in a good mood.  She said that I acted like I barely cared when our son was telling us about the hockey game and how much fun it was.  I asked her if she was seriously confused about why I was upset and she told me to tell her.  

So, I started railing off all the reasons I had to be pissed off.  She volunteered me to help, she got to spend the day doing something very special with our son that I missed out on, her brother and his GF were not prepared, and I had spent the entire day doing manual labor.  I ended my little rant by telling her that she is never going to volunteer me to help her family ever again.  

She told me I was overreacting and I can't hold it against her that her friend invited them to the game. She also said I'm not being fair by blaming her for Joe and his GF.  ","AITA For telling my wife to never volunteer me to help her family againMy wife (38F) and I (39M) have been married for 8 years and have a 4-year-old son.  My wife's younger brother (Joe) and his GF are moving into an apartment together at the beginning of June.  But GF's lease is up at the end of April so she needed to move out of her place.  But Joe currently lives in a studio apartment so he doesn't have room for all her stuff.  So they were going to move all of GF's stuff into a storage unit for a month until they get their new place together.

A little over a month ago Joe had asked my wife if we would be able to help them move GF's stuff and she agreed.  My MIL was supposed to watch our son so we could both help, but she fell ill and had to cancel.  My wife suggested trying to get a babysitter for that day but I didn't want to spend hundreds on a babysitter to help someone move, that's dumb.  And bringing a 4-year-old with us would not be helpful to anyone.

My mother has never really liked June for a couple reasons, the main one being the fact that June didn't let my mom push her around. She kept firm boundaries which I really admired and she even helped me do the same. My mom hated this, calling June controlling and wishing I hadn't broken up with my previous girlfriend Margo, who my mom loved. I was with Margo for 5 years and it was horrible. Margo was very controlling and manipulative and always guilted me into things I wasn't comfortable with. But thanks to support from friends and my sister, I was able to leave her. It was hard, but I had help and my life has improved since. My mom was very upset with this but relationships didn't last so she eventually let it go until I started dating June about a year later.

When June and I announced our engagement my mom didn't freak out, which was weird considering my mom hates June. She was very calm but I just took it as she was finally accepting this and so I didn't think much of it.

Everything was fine and smooth up until the wedding. I gave both my parents plus one’s to the wedding since they both remarried after I graduated college. So I’m not close to their spouses but gave them the option of inviting them.  We had a very small ceremony. Just immediate family and a few close friends. After the ceremony, me and June went to take pictures and then met back with everyone we invited to the reception which was pretty big. When we got there, My sister and June’s best friend/maid of honor ran up to us in a panic. Before they even said anything I spotted it. My mom was at the table with my dad, my dad's wife, and Margo.

I wanted to freak but June kept me calm. I walked over, pulled them both aside, and simply told them to leave. My mom tried to explain Margo and I are soulmates and June is just in the way of true love but I wasn't hearing it. I didn't care. Just got my best friends to escort them out and I returned to the party where luckily, after a few moments, I was able to relax and enjoy it.

I really didn't think this would all turn into something huge but me and June just got back from our honeymoon where we didn't have our phones, and seeing mine I saw hundreds of texts from multiple family members.

They all think I was an asshole for kicking my mom out of her only son's wedding. For the record, she was there for the ceremony but apparently was really upset she was kicked from the reception. Here's a summary of my family's thoughts. Some think I could have just ignored Margo and didn't have to “freak out.” A few others, including my dad, think I should have just kicked Margo and let my mom stay but after the stunt my mom pulled, I didn't want her there either.

I’m starting to second-guess myself since everyone is really mad. June and my sister are on my side but I fear my dad may be right and I should have just let my mom stay and made Margo leave.

They mentioned several things, like me drinking every night, that I wasn’t acting like a “girls’ girl,” that I booked different flights, didn't hang out with them enough, and that I was selfish for not helping with their kids.

**Edit:** Thank you, Reddit, for all your kind words and support. Reading through the responses and seeing how many of you are upset on my behalf has made me reflect on how I initially planned to handle things. I was going to apologize, thinking it might be the easiest way to keep the peace, but now I realize that might not be the right approach after all.

I have also showed my husband, Jake, this post and the text message, and he told me to thank you for looking out for me. He’s actually pretty angry on my behalf about the text message. I showed him some of the comments that gave me insight on how my friends may have been feeling which has given us both a lot to think about.

He asked me what I wanted to do next and if I wanted him to respond to my friends for me. While I appreciated the offer, I told him I’m still thinking it over. He reassured me that he’s here for me no matter what, and if I decide I want him to step in, he’d be ready to say something on my behalf.

For now, I’m going to sleep on it and take some time before I respond or don't respond to the text message. If I do, I'll post an update. Again, thank you all for helping me see things a bit more clearly. I feel less alone in this now.

Laura really likes using mental health terminology. She explores a lot of labels from those therapist influencers online. She's was told that she has an anxiety disorder and depression but that's the only diagnosis she's been given so far. Recently she's been exploring autism and ADHD.

Matt wanted to propose to Grace. They've been dating for a while. He's been planning the proposal for a couple of weeks and while the proposal was very intimate between the two of them I was very involved in scheduling the after-proposal event at a restaurant. The specifics of that are irrelevant to the story but it was lovely and Grace and Matt seemed really happy.

Laura told us that she didn't want to be involved in planning the proposal because it reminded her of her parents' divorce. She said that she might come to the post-engagement party. Well come the day of the engagement and both Matt and I forget to check in on Laura. I don't think it's Matt's fault at all because he was occupied with far more important things but I feel a bit guilty about not reminding her. She ended up not coming to the party.

The next day she starts posting online some dramatic (for lack of a better word) things about how it was traumatizing to see how little her friends cared about her, and that she'll be updating her followers on her trauma therapy journey. She posts that she's now in a really dark place and she thinks she has PTSD.

For context, I'm pretty sensitive to mentions of trauma and PTSD because I was diagnosed with PTSD by a psychologist in my last year of high school after something that happened in my first. I've felt a lot of guilt and shame around this because I spent a lot of time feeling that the thing that happened wasn't bad enough to count. I sometimes still get nightmares and flashbacks but it's gotten better after therapy. I know that I have my own issues wrapped up regarding the word and it bothers me a lot when people seem to throw the terms around without understanding their weight but I also acknowledge that I can't stop the internet from doing its thing.

I haven't told any of my college friends about this, so Laura doesn't know. At one point she called me and starting explaining how traumatized she is and I finally snapped and said, ""You're not traumatized, stop being dramatic, you just got exactly what you asked for.""

Now I feel guilty because I feel like I was a little harsh, and she's posting online (without my name at least) that one friend that she thought she could rely on to support her is abusive and doesn't understand how being traumatized works. However, I feel like honestly, Laura's being very dramatic about an event that's not about her. I called my mom to see what her opinion is and she told me that I could've reminded Laura about the party and while my point is not necessarily wrong, I could've been more sensitive, so now I'm not sure how wrong I am.","AITA for telling my friend that she isn't traumatized from somebody else's proposal?I (20f) have had three close friends in college, Grace (21f), Matt (21m), and Laura (21f).

The next day she starts posting online some dramatic (for lack of a better word) things about how it was traumatizing to see how little her friends cared about her, and that she'll be updating her followers on her trauma therapy journey. She posts that she's now in a really dark place and she thinks she has PTSD.

For context, I'm pretty sensitive to mentions of trauma and PTSD because I was diagnosed with PTSD by a psychologist in my last year of high school after something that happened in my first. I've felt a lot of guilt and shame around this because I spent a lot of time feeling that the thing that happened wasn't bad enough to count. I sometimes still get nightmares and flashbacks but it's gotten better after therapy. I know that I have my own issues wrapped up regarding the word and it bothers me a lot when people seem to throw the terms around without understanding their weight but I also acknowledge that I can't stop the internet from doing its thing.

I haven't told any of my college friends about this, so Laura doesn't know. At one point she called me and starting explaining how traumatized she is and I finally snapped and said, ""You're not traumatized, stop being dramatic, you just got exactly what you asked for.""

Now I feel guilty because I feel like I was a little harsh, and she's posting online (without my name at least) that one friend that she thought she could rely on to support her is abusive and doesn't understand how being traumatized works. However, I feel like honestly, Laura's being very dramatic about an event that's not about her. I called my mom to see what her opinion is and she told me that I could've reminded Laura about the party and while my point is not necessarily wrong, I could've been more sensitive, so now I'm not sure how wrong I am.",False,False,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my friend that she isn't traumatized from somebody else's proposal?,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1e8lhsg/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_she_isnt/

My brother is 29 and has been with Lia for about 2 years. We all like her; she is super nice. I am getting married next April and sent an invite to my brother's apartment. We decided to send invites to households and not individuals. For example, our aunt received an invite for her family and not for each individual.

Last Thursday, we met at my parents' place. It was just the core family because of some tax reasons, lol. While there, I asked my brother about Lia's dietary restrictions. I know that she is a vegetarian for health reasons and that she cannot have certain raw vegetables.

He said that she wasn't going to come and that he was taking his girl best friend, Amanda, instead. Now, their relationship is weird af. Amanda has always been stringing my brother along, in my opinion. He always denies having feelings for her, but let's be real here.

Amanda would date other guys, blow off my brother, then when things were on the decline with her partners, she would be attached to him again. Her last boyfriend broke up with her right around the time my brother, his then ex-girlfriend, Amanda, and her ex were supposed to travel to Spain. What did my idiot brother do? Go with Amanda alone because Amanda was uncomfortable with his ex-girlfriend. Obviously, he acted blindsided when his girlfriend broke up with him. I didn't even say anything anymore because it's all so weird.

So, when he said that, I asked if Lia already had other plans. But my brother said that Amanda had asked if she could come because it would be an opportunity to finally see the old gang (we were in the same friend group in high school). I told him that I would have invited Amanda if I wanted her there. Amanda is mean and cold. She always makes disparaging comments about other girls. At every event, around one hour in, she will make some sort of scene that either has her running away crying or sitting mad at a table telling everyone to ""leave her alone"" and then making a cryptic comment about something ""hurting her.""

I told my brother I was revoking his plus one and Amanda was NOT coming to our wedding. He accused me of being misogynistic and bigoted because I don't understand opposite-sex friendships. Which is BS. My husband has a female childhood friend who is his best woman. I love her too and she has been amazing. AND SHE RESPECTS FUCKING BOUNDARIES. She always includes me and made a huge effort when I started dating my fiancé to integrate me into the friend group.

Anyway, I said my decision was final. He could take it or leave it, but I would be inviting Lia myself because I like her. He screamed at me and told me to keep out of his business. I said to get rid of his weird fucking feelings for Amanda.
He is mad at me. My dad said is none of our deal. My mom is furious with my brother. So Aita?


Edit: to answer some questions 

The invite was addressed to the ""smith's."" Funnily enough, Lia had the same last name as us. Granted, we have one of the most common last names.

Yes, they live together.


The tax thing is nothing huge. My parents have a small buisness but are really bad at keeping track of all their receipts. So every month we go and help them. We digitalis the receipts and put them in a bookkeeping software for the accountant

At 18 she left to live at her aunts. She robbed the place and my sister pressed charges. She almost went to jail and after that she started to turn her life around.

She made a comment about how cally is the golden child and that is why she had a good childhood with opportunity while hers sucked.

I told her no, cally is not the golden child and the reason she had opportunities that you didn't have was because we could trust Cally. As a teenager you proved over and over again thag you were not to be trusted.

I realize this was probably very petty but I want to see if I am justified or just an asshole and owe an apology.

My son ""Sam"" had his ninth birthday today, but we're having the actual ""party"" tomorrow night, which is basically just a sleepover at our apartment with two friends. One is in his class and the other in a different one(same school though). Before my son even got home from the bus I got a call from his teacher ""Lorna"" requesting that the party involve all the students in the class. She learned about it because it came up as the class wished him a happy birthday. I at first politely refused, saying that's not reasonable but she insisted to make sure nobody was left out. I respond by saying that she has no say in who is at my home ever and that even if she did, my apartment simply cannot accommodate 32 kids and guardians. She says that because other students are involved, she does and that I should have the party somewhere that can allow all students.

  
I was ready to either hang up or tell her off, but what she said at the end sparked an idea. I tell her ""Okay, what's your address?"" and when she asks why, I told that since you think you have a say and you want all your students to be a part, we might as well have the party have her house, and request her address again. There's a pause before she says that's not exactly what she meant and I tell her that no, she wants everyone to attend so she should be the one to make it work, before hanging up.

This is where I probably became the asshole. Out of curiosity I easily found her address(her SM is not private at all) and email her ""how does this email sound?"" with an excerpt to the group email chain saying that Lorna has offered to host Sam's birthday party at her home and to come after school to X address. I was NOT planning on actually sending that to anyone else but her, I just wanted to prove the point and felt I was being sarcastic but I know tone is hard online. She responded to not send it and to do whatever I want for the birthday, she does not care anymore.

AITA.","AITA for suggesting my teacher host my son's party at her house?Throwaway and fake names. I realize this was probably very petty but I want to see if I am justified or just an asshole and owe an apology.

My son ""Sam"" had his ninth birthday today, but we're having the actual ""party"" tomorrow night, which is basically just a sleepover at our apartment with two friends. One is in his class and the other in a different one(same school though). Before my son even got home from the bus I got a call from his teacher ""Lorna"" requesting that the party involve all the students in the class. She learned about it because it came up as the class wished him a happy birthday. I at first politely refused, saying that's not reasonable but she insisted to make sure nobody was left out. I respond by saying that she has no say in who is at my home ever and that even if she did, my apartment simply cannot accommodate 32 kids and guardians. She says that because other students are involved, she does and that I should have the party somewhere that can allow all students.

  
I was ready to either hang up or tell her off, but what she said at the end sparked an idea. I tell her ""Okay, what's your address?"" and when she asks why, I told that since you think you have a say and you want all your students to be a part, we might as well have the party have her house, and request her address again. There's a pause before she says that's not exactly what she meant and I tell her that no, she wants everyone to attend so she should be the one to make it work, before hanging up.

This is where I probably became the asshole. Out of curiosity I easily found her address(her SM is not private at all) and email her ""how does this email sound?"" with an excerpt to the group email chain saying that Lorna has offered to host Sam's birthday party at her home and to come after school to X address. I was NOT planning on actually sending that to anyone else but her, I just wanted to prove the point and felt I was being sarcastic but I know tone is hard online. She responded to not send it and to do whatever I want for the birthday, she does not care anymore.

George is very bright, projected to get 8s or 9s in his GCSEs, and regularly achieves these grades in his mock exams and assessments. But he struggles socially and has been bullied badly in the past. Things are better now, but he isn’t popular. 

As part of his PD class, he had to create a children’s toy and give a sales pitch to the class. Last Friday was the presentation day, and George was really excited. He’d put a lot of effort into his toy and the presentation.

But I got a notification saying George had been given a C3 (after-school detention), something he’s never received before. As he’d refused to participate in class and didn’t do his presentation. When I picked him up, I could tell immediately that he was upset.

I asked him what happened and why he didn’t do the presentation. He said he didn’t refuse the presentation; when it was his turn, he asked to go later. His teacher said no, and that he had to do it then or get a C3. George said he “couldn’t do it now,” but didn’t explain further when asked, so he was given the C3.

I kept pressing him, worried that maybe he was being bullied again. Eventually, he told me the real reason: he had a random erection just before his turn and, no matter what, it “wouldn’t go down”.

With that info, I think George’s request was perfectly reasonable. He didn’t refuse to do the presentation—he simply asked to do it a little later. Obviously, he didn’t want to explain the reason in front of the whole class when the teacher asked him.

His mum was really angry with him for getting the C3. I explained what happened and said I didn’t think George was wrong. I said I’m not supporting the detention and would pick him up at the normal time. When I told his mum what happened, she looked disgusted and said something like, “Why did he even have one in class to begin with?” I explained that random erections happen, especially in early puberty, and they don’t always relate to sexual thoughts, which is what she was assuming. She replied, “Well, I’m not sure that’s true,” dismissing what I said. So I told her, “You might not be sure, but I am.”

She insisted we needed to present a united front, along with the school, and that by going against her, I was sending George the wrong message. I asked why her way of handling it was automatically right and why I should be the one to concede. It escalated into a big argument, which we haven’t had in years. 

She’s saying she is going to punish him for refusing when it’s her week with him next week and that I am being an AH for “going against her”. Her mother text me saying I was setting a bad example for George by letting him get away with being disrespectful to his teacher. Which he wasn’t even, just asked to do his presentation later. I respectfully told her she should mind her own business, and that George was my son.

I (33F) received a terminal diagnosis earlier this year. I’ve got a couple of years at best estimate to get everything in order before I won’t have the cognitive ability to do so anymore. I’ve been working with a lawyer and an end of life care social worker to make sure everything will go as smoothly as possible and my wishes will be respected.

I also have a complicated family situation.  My parents were never married and my dad died when I was 12 of the same condition I now have. He never married so all his assets were put in a trust for me by my grandparents. My mom married after they broke up and had my half-brother (26M).  He is severely mentally disabled. He’s a 7 year old in a grown man’s body and even with all the resources they can get, he’s very difficult to care for and my mom and step-dad barely get by most of the time.  They tried really hard to get legal control of my trust when I was living with them, but couldn’t. I help out some when things are really hard, but I feel like my mom treats me like an emergency fund rather than her daughter and my step-dad has been bitter about the financial stuff (my dad was very successful and his family is well off) since even before my dad died. I don’t talk to either of them about my life because they always get passive aggressive and guilt-trippy.

I’ve been trying to talk more with my mom now that I know I’m on borrowed time. We’ve never had a great relationship, but I wanted to try and resolve some of it. She’s been much nicer to me and more concerned since the diagnosis, so I thought it was ok to open up a bit.  I didn’t want her to be blind-sided or feel like she has to take on anything since I’ve appointed another family member to be my medical and financial POA, so I talked to her recently about my plans. I told her that I know my half-brother is a full time job so I’m having other people take care of my care so she won’t be burdened. She was thankful for that, but then brought up how she always hoped that I would be the one to make sure my brother was taken care of when she was gone and that in a way I still would be. She would put whatever I leave behind into his care fund and would make sure he knows it’s from his big sister.

This is where I might be the AH.  I’m not leaving anything to my mom or brother. I don’t have kids, but I have been the favorite “auntie” to my best friend’s two children for their entire lives. They are the light of my life and I spend a lot of time with them.  My BFF and I have been through a lot together. She and her husband have been the ones going with me to appointments and letting me crash in their spare room when I was too sick from meds to be home alone.  Whatever is left over after I’m gone is going to the kids for college. I know it’s money that could secure better care for my half-brother and take some of the load off my mom, but I feel like I want to help someone else now.

Edit - Thank you for the best wishes. To answer a couple of questions: (a) I am not at all close to my half-brother, I didn’t really meet him until my dad passed and the 6 years I spent around him were painful and frightening. I haven’t seen him in person in 15 years. It’s not clear that he even understands that he has a sister or what that means and I would be really surprised if he remembered me at all. So, it’s not that I don’t care - I care to the same extent that I would about the welfare of any random mentally disabled stranger - I just don’t have any special interest or warm family feelings about him because we share DNA. I’ve also already put a lot of money into helping my mom stay solvent to care for him, so there’s an argument to be made that he’s already received a reasonable share of benefit in life. As much as my mom refuses to believe it, I would never have accepted legal responsibility for him after her death. His dad has family that could step in if they were willing. (b) I am working with a good team already to get things in order. My estate lawyer is very good at his job and he and my financial advisor are prepared to firmly lock down everything once I’ve made the final decisions about where my assets should go.

I just have to make a few hard decisions that I didn’t expect to ever have to make.

Thinking about some things people have said in this thread, it may be just be time to end the sentence on my relationship with my mom and her family and move on. I’ve always held out hope that she cared in her own way and that things could be better, but I’m really tired and I’m not sure I want to spend what’s left of my time chasing it and trying to figure out whether she can even be trusted to manage any money I could leave to them.

","AITA for not leaving my estate to my severely disabled brother?
I (33F) received a terminal diagnosis earlier this year. I’ve got a couple of years at best estimate to get everything in order before I won’t have the cognitive ability to do so anymore. I’ve been working with a lawyer and an end of life care social worker to make sure everything will go as smoothly as possible and my wishes will be respected.

I also have a complicated family situation.  My parents were never married and my dad died when I was 12 of the same condition I now have. He never married so all his assets were put in a trust for me by my grandparents. My mom married after they broke up and had my half-brother (26M).  He is severely mentally disabled. He’s a 7 year old in a grown man’s body and even with all the resources they can get, he’s very difficult to care for and my mom and step-dad barely get by most of the time.  They tried really hard to get legal control of my trust when I was living with them, but couldn’t. I help out some when things are really hard, but I feel like my mom treats me like an emergency fund rather than her daughter and my step-dad has been bitter about the financial stuff (my dad was very successful and his family is well off) since even before my dad died. I don’t talk to either of them about my life because they always get passive aggressive and guilt-trippy.

I’ve been trying to talk more with my mom now that I know I’m on borrowed time. We’ve never had a great relationship, but I wanted to try and resolve some of it. She’s been much nicer to me and more concerned since the diagnosis, so I thought it was ok to open up a bit.  I didn’t want her to be blind-sided or feel like she has to take on anything since I’ve appointed another family member to be my medical and financial POA, so I talked to her recently about my plans. I told her that I know my half-brother is a full time job so I’m having other people take care of my care so she won’t be burdened. She was thankful for that, but then brought up how she always hoped that I would be the one to make sure my brother was taken care of when she was gone and that in a way I still would be. She would put whatever I leave behind into his care fund and would make sure he knows it’s from his big sister.

She constantly lays on the “southern charm” thing thick. She calls everyone “honey” and “sweetie” and all of that. She also tends to chit chat with people instead of just letting them eat after bringing them their food or drinks. It’s also kind of obvious that a lot of them don’t want to really talk to her, they give one word answers and she just barrels forward and talks at them.  (Management has told her off more than once for this) 

About two weeks ago she was upset because a customer yelled at her and said “Don’t call me that!” when she called her “honey” and she complains that she’s not getting as many tips as the other servers. She says it’s because she has a southern accent and customers think she’s stupid, but I don’t think that’s the case. 

She asked me for advice, and I said it’s because she takes so long to bring things out and wastes time trying to make small talk. I also said that the excessive pet names sound kind of condescending, and they aren’t really something you would call a stranger here. 

She told me that she wasn’t going to start being rude to customers because she would make even less money. I told her it’s not being rude, it’s just how things work here, and it’s rude to other customers she’s supposed to be serving when she spends all her time trying to make small talk instead of doing her job and calling them weird things. 

Now she’s mad and has been avoiding me.

One of my coworkers moved up here from Georgia for college and started working here a few months ago.

She constantly lays on the “southern charm” thing thick. She calls everyone “honey” and “sweetie” and all of that. She also tends to chit chat with people instead of just letting them eat after bringing them their food or drinks. It’s also kind of obvious that a lot of them don’t want to really talk to her, they give one word answers and she just barrels forward and talks at them.  (Management has told her off more than once for this)

While my mom financially provided for my sister and myself, she was emotionally hands off. She came to a ballet recital here and there but didn’t want to help with homework, didn’t want to listen when we needed advice, etc. Our dad did 95% of the emotional labor. I later found out from my mom that my dad was the one who wanted kids. She loved her career and didn’t mind providing financially but she did not want to do any of the stuff related to raising us outside of that. I am very grateful she provided for us financially, but I do admit it hurts that she wasn’t there when we needed her. She was physically present but not emotionally present.

EDIT: as this has come up, to be clear, the arrangement was my mother’s idea, not my father’s. That being said, I do agree that my father was equally as selfish for making this arrangement. 

My dad always did grand gestures for her. Mother’s Day was always a big deal with a huge brunch, flowers, gifts. She was spoiled. She did nothing for him on Father’s Day. He had to do everything for himself until my sister and I were old enough to do stuff for him. I get that was the arrangement they had but I know it made my dad sad. I once asked why he didn’t get the same hoopla our mom got and he just sadly said “father’s day isn’t as important as Mother’s Day.”

As adults, my sister and I have tried to rectify it. We do Father’s Day up big and our dad loves it. We grill for him just how he taught us and throw a huge BBQ with some other family members. However, we’ve turned Mother’s Day very lowkey. We still celebrate our mom but she usually gets a quiet lunch at a restaurant of her choice and a few gifts. After my mom ended up skipping my sister’s baby shower this year because “she didn’t see the big deal with someone having a baby”, my sister wanted to do nothing for her. We sent gifts but spent Mother’s Day with each other, our husbands and our own kids. 

My mom told us after Father’s Day that she was hurt we didn’t do more for her in recent years. I said that since she put in almost no emotional labor into raising us, we are putting none into her. She said that our father and I had an agreement. I pointed out that yes, but we never agreed to it and it want fair that we grew up with an emotionally absent mother who didn’t want us.  And to be fair, we have had this conversation with our dad as well and he admits it wasn’t fair to us either. I also said if she didn’t want kids, then why should she be celebrated as a mom?

My mom is upset with both of us and called us ungrateful brats. My dad feels bad for her but supports our choice. AITA? 


EDIT: To those asking how I’d feel if my dad were the one that acted like this/how I feel about dads who do this in general: they suck just as much and it’s not fair to the kids, regardless of whatever agreement spouses come to.

We started therapy a few weeks after Father's Day, because that was the final straw for them to insist we all needed therapy to work on why I won't let us be the family they want. We started at the end of July and by the end of August my mom accused me of lying, called me a liar and laid out this really big sob story about how much it hurt to have me lie to her and do everything in my power to destroy her marriage.

It pissed me off so bad. I didn't lie at any point of this. I said as much in the follow up session and the therapist asked me to outline my side and how I felt having mom call me a liar. My mom kept trying to interrupt me, she told the therapist the shut up and she accused me of being a vicious liar then.

To give some explanation about the situation. My mom and her husband got married 3 years ago. They moved in together 2 months before. Before moving in they sat me down and asked me if I was okay with us moving in together and making a family of three again. Mom brought up how we'd have a man around the house again (my dad died) and how good it would be for her to have a husband and for me to have a dad and he said he couldn't wait to be my dad and he always wanted to be a dad. He said he already had plans for us for Father's Day. This was February of three years ago. I told them I wasn't okay with that stuff. That I didn't want another dad, wouldn't let him be my dad, and was not about to spend Father's Day celebrating someone who isn't dad. They started laughing and proceeded as normal but Father's Day became a struggle because I have not spent the day with him the last three years and he has tried, so has my mom. I meant what I said. I never called him dad or let him fill the role in my life. This year he snapped and he had a temper tantrum and said I was supposed to be with him on Father's Day and not spending the day alone and he didn't sign up to be nothing to me.

My mom called me a liar because she said I promised to develop a close relationship with her husband and that I said yes to wanting what they asked. She said I had said I would give him Father's Day and I lied and I have not followed through on any of it. She said I made them think I would be a willing participant and I wanted us to be a family. It pisses me off because I never said what she claims and I even repeated what I had said back then. 

The therapist couldn't get mom to apologize and she has no control over the sessions where my mom and her husband dominate. So I'm totally silent and I zone out. They only realized this two weeks ago. They called me on it and I spoke up again after more than a month of no talking in therapy, to confirm I wasn't listening and it came up last week and I said I was done engaging because I was owed an apology for being called a liar. My mom and her husband are pissed that I'm wasting everyone's time letting therapy happen.

My husband (32M) and I (30F) had a vegan wedding because we’re both vegan. We made it clear in advance that the food and cake would be plant-based, and no one complained—until the reception.

The cake was gorgeous: three-tiers decorated with edible flowers. Toward the end of the night, one of my husband’s aunts, Linda, came up to me looking visibly upset. She said it was “disrespectful” to have a vegan cake on display because it felt like I was “pushing my lifestyle” on everyone.

I told her the cake wasn’t meant to make a statement, it was just the dessert we chose for our wedding. She insisted I either move the cake off the main table or add a sign saying it was vegan so people weren’t “tricked” into eating it.

I won't be around the new sibling as much and the relationship might not be the same. I told them I don't want the same relationship either. I don't want to be a parent to another sibling.

They made it pretty clear they don't want to do the actual child raising and they're living a nightmare over this. When the topic came up during the last week I told them they need to place the baby for adoption since they won't have a good childhood with nobody wanting to raise them.

But I wasn't going to skip my own life to raise an infant from the start. My parents were shocked. They tried to get one of my younger siblings on board but they said no way, they didn't want to be responsible like me. My parents returned to me with the topic and asked what the fuck they're meant to do and they never expected me to reject a sibling like this. I said I reject child raising another one of *their* kids. Not a sibling. But also, I'll be out of the house in 7 months. I won't be around the new sibling as much and the relationship might not be the same. I told them I don't want the same relationship either. I don't want to be a parent to another sibling.

They made it pretty clear they don't want to do the actual child raising and they're living a nightmare over this. When the topic came up during the last week I told them they need to place the baby for adoption since they won't have a good childhood with nobody wanting to raise them. I told my parents it would be the kindest thing to do if they refuse to raise the baby themselves.

My parents accused me of treating adoption flippantly and they were sorta outraged I would rather they place the baby for adoption than for me to step up and raise this one too.

The reason I chose a trade was that I grew up in a trailer with my mom and sister, and I have wanted to own a house since I can remember, and being in the trades gave me access to a stable job and access to more money sooner. My partner, 29F, Thea, is a plumber, and we have scrounged and saved. In the end we bought land and built a tiny house in the uptown area of our city. It has two bedrooms and one bathroom, one of the bedrooms is our reptile room, as I keep snakes and Thea keeps bearded dragons. We are child-free and happy in our home.

My Sister ""Lucy"" 34F, is a waitress and has three kids (M4, M3, M2). Her husband just left her for a woman my age and she is left without his income to raise all three kids on her own. Her husband bought out her half of the house during the divorce and that left her and the kids living with my mom in the trailer.

I can admit I didn't grow up in the safest of areas and was carrying a knife when I was a teenager because of the danger. Because of the safety issue, Lucy came to Thea and I and begged us to let her and her sons move in. She said we would have to get rid of our reptiles or keep them in our room, her sons could have the other bedroom, and she would sleep in our kitchen on an air mattress. She said nothing about paying us rent or helping around the house.

I told her no, because two toddlers and a little kid who is about to start kindergarten aren't suitable to be in our home and we don't want too many people in our house. She said that we live in a better part of town with better schools and that she needed the help. I told her we didn't have the room and that I was sorry, but I could hook her up with some journeymen I know and she could get started on an apprenticeship that pays better than her current job if she needed extra money.

She called my job and Thea's job ""Dirty blue collar trash"" and left our home. She posted about how we wouldn't let her stay online, and now my relatives are messaging me about, ""How could I let a single mother and 3 kids be homeless,"" How ""they're your blood,"" and ""You owe your sister better than that."" I feel like a complete asshole even though Thea told me I have every right not to want them in our house. AITA?

  
AFTER DINNER WITH MY XBIL EDIT: Thea and I went to dinner with my XBIL tonight. He brought his laptop and showed us all of the documentation.  
1.) Lucy used her proceeds from the house to pay for her attorney, even though my XBIL offered to pay (timestamped e-mails to prove it)  
2.) The woman living with him is his niece, not his AP, as Lucy claimed. (She came to the meeting; they have pictures and phone records showing that she is my XBIL's older sister's daughter.)  
3.) LUCY CHEATED: ALL 3 BOYS AREN'T HIS. And DNA tests show that they all have different dads. So Lucy has been having multiple affairs.   
4.) The 300 he is sending each month is a good will payment for allowing him to be a dad for a few years.   
5.) Lucy isn't waitressing, she is working for Amway and another company called Sentsy in direct sales.  
6.) Lucy won't do an apprenticeship because it doesn't fall under traditional gender roles (posts on a second social media account)

I took him out for lunch the following week to thank him for saving me, and we soon fell in love and began dating. 

At the time, Vince worked a blue collar job while I was studying in university. We ended up getting married and Vince supported me throughout my entire education up until I got my PhD. 

Vince always told me that he wanted to study in university but had learning disabilities that made it difficult for him to study in a classroom. At times he was embarrassed by the fact that he had to work twice as hard compared to people around him, but I always found that to be admirable about him. 

When I finished my studies and got a well paying job I convinced Vince to give his dream of studying another go. 

Last year he was finally accepted into a nursing program at our local university. He is working hard to achieve him dream and I’m incredibly proud of him.

Last week my friend Alba (36F) came to visit with her son so our children could play together. Alba was my roommate during my first year in university, she began dating her husband Leo around the same time I started dating Vince. 

Leo was an obnoxious law student who later on became an even more obnoxious attorney. He was a know it all who prided himself on his intelligence, which for some reason attracted Alba. 

At the time Alba would sometimes tease me that I could do better than Vince, and would offer to set me up with one of Leo’s law school buddies, but I would always refuse and she eventually dropped the subject. 

Alba and Leo are currently going through a nasty divorce that stems from him cheating on her, quite frankly he is dragging her through the mud and is using connections to try and leave her as penniless as possible. 

As we were chatting and catching up Alba began to express concern over the fact that my eldest son (7M) was recently diagnosed with dyslexia, Alba began telling me how she is worried that my son will be academically challenged like his father and what that could entail for his future. Before I could respond she told me how I should have married someone smart while I had the chance so I would have kids like hers. (Albas son is an incredibly bright boy and a straight A student).

I told Alba her advice was unnecessary and reminded her where marrying for intelligence got her, I then proceeded to tell her that I would rather have my son grow up to be an honest, hardworking person like his father than an academically gifted jerk who wasn’t smart enough to know sleeping with his secretary could have consequences on his marriage like her husband. 

Alba was deeply hurt by what I’ve said and stormed out with her son. Some mutual friends are now chiming in and are telling me that
I was too harsh on Alba for using her failing marriage to prove my point and should apologize.

Small update: first of all I want to thank you all for your replies :) 

I wanted to address a couple of things, many of you asked why Alba and I remained friends despite her previous remarks. Alba and I grew apart during our third year in university, we only remained friends by association since we have a lot of shared mutual friends. 

We became close again after our sons started playing basketball together at the local community center and became friends. I figured that becoming a mother made her more mature and she didn’t give me any reason to suspect otherwise. 

I’ve decided to send her a message saying that the way she spoke about my husband and son was unacceptable and therefore she is no longer welcomed in my home, however, I don’t want our sons to lose their friendship and therefore I’m willing to remain civil around the kids and still organize play dates. She didn’t reply to me just yet, but I truly hope she loves her son enough to put her ego aside and remain civil for the sake of our kids.

I’ve yet to notify Vince about this entire situation since he is vigorously studying for an important quiz that’s coming up next week, and I know that if he heard what Alba said about him and our boy it would make him upset and he won’t be able to continue studying properly. Unless something crazy happens in the meantime I’ll probably update him next week after he’s done with the quiz. 
","AITA for reminding my friend that she married for intelligence and look where it got her?I (35F) met my husband Vince (36M) after he saved me from drowning at a pool party when I was 18. I took him out for lunch the following week to thank him for saving me, and we soon fell in love and began dating. 

At the time, Vince worked a blue collar job while I was studying in university. We ended up getting married and Vince supported me throughout my entire education up until I got my PhD. 

Vince always told me that he wanted to study in university but had learning disabilities that made it difficult for him to study in a classroom. At times he was embarrassed by the fact that he had to work twice as hard compared to people around him, but I always found that to be admirable about him. 

When I finished my studies and got a well paying job I convinced Vince to give his dream of studying another go. 

Last year he was finally accepted into a nursing program at our local university. He is working hard to achieve him dream and I’m incredibly proud of him.

Last week my friend Alba (36F) came to visit with her son so our children could play together. Alba was my roommate during my first year in university, she began dating her husband Leo around the same time I started dating Vince. 

Leo was an obnoxious law student who later on became an even more obnoxious attorney. He was a know it all who prided himself on his intelligence, which for some reason attracted Alba. 

At the time Alba would sometimes tease me that I could do better than Vince, and would offer to set me up with one of Leo’s law school buddies, but I would always refuse and she eventually dropped the subject. 

Alba and Leo are currently going through a nasty divorce that stems from him cheating on her, quite frankly he is dragging her through the mud and is using connections to try and leave her as penniless as possible.

The first time he brought her over I took it quite formally and cooked up a feast but it soon became obvious it’s becoming a daily thing and not just a one time formal thing.

The first meeting she came quite a bit late and the food was cold by the time she came. No pardons or anything and when we were done everyone helped to pack up. And we thought she would kind of get the notion but since it was her first time here we didn’t say anything.

As for deserts I like to do this thing example for cupcake I will prepare the icing and everyone would gather and decorate their desert but she made it quite clear from the get go she wasn’t interested in it and stuff.

So for basically the last month she’s almost here daily and she would request for specific dishes with no thanks and stuff. My other son(17m) has also verbally called him out on her not contributing anything gently but she said something around the lines of “no ring, no wife duties”. I don’t see this as a wife duty? I would do this for my friends hangout and everyone in my house put a hand in. My daughters, my husband and my sons.

So today when my son told me that she requested a specific meat pie for dinner I am quite done, however I don’t want to affect my relationship with my son over this. Especially since he really likes her a lot but I’m really considering banning her from our dinners.

Edit: the reason I have such a big problem with this is because my other children has brought their mates back. My eldest son and his girlfriend is living in my house actually but none of them have a problem like this. It was almost natural of them to contribute. Also I don’t have a problem with not wanting to decorate but it’s the idea of her not joining in on family. Like movie night and everything she would just stay in the room alone, even my son was in the living room.

Edit: yes it was verbally communicated to her that she’s expected to help out after maybe a few weeks but she replied with the “no ring, no wife duties” ideology. And no, my son isn’t able to get his own place. It’s expensive and you need to be married to get a house. He can’t just move out

The only condition of the subsidy is that she actually has to show up. If she misses too many days I lose the subsidy. I go to work at 7:30 and daycare opens at 8 so my mom would be the one to take Anna to daycare. 

Anna's main teacher is a 20/21 year old girl. When I've talked to her she's always been very animated and energetic. She's great with the kids. Anna always comes home saying this teacher brought stickers, she brought juice, she brought bubbles, she did face painting, etc. and always has fun crafts that she did with her teacher. This teacher is her favorite person in the world right now and Anna often runs away from my mom to jump on this teacher in the mornings and hides when my mom picks her up because she doesn't want to leave this teacher.

My mom started to get jealous that Anna likes the teacher better than her so she started keeping her home from daycare on her days off/when she only has 1-2 easy clients (she cleans houses).

I asked my mom about it and she told me she wanted Anna to spend more time with family instead of with teachers I told my mom Anna needs to be in daycare unless she's sick or I would lose the subsidy.

I told him it’s not that big a deal and that I really want to stay to get cheesecake because it’s my favorite, I eventually even offered to try to get some to go and he was dead set that we need to leave and didn’t understand why I wasn’t mortified. 

We ended up staying but for the rest of the date he kept saying that the men at tables near us were staring at me and probably thinking about me inappropriately but I said it wasn’t my problem if they’re being gross. 

When we got in the car he told me i ruined our anniversary for making him sit through that and we should have just left and that he can’t believe I would choose a piece of cheesecake over his comfortability.

He said that I was being overdramatic for the way I reacted in the situation and maybe I was but it did startle me really bad and it did burn. He told me I had put on a show for everyone in the restaurant especially since I screamed when it happened and that we need to leave. 

I told him it’s not that big a deal and that I really want to stay to get cheesecake because it’s my favorite, I eventually even offered to try to get some to go and he was dead set that we need to leave and didn’t understand why I wasn’t mortified. 

We ended up staying but for the rest of the date he kept saying that the men at tables near us were staring at me and probably thinking about me inappropriately but I said it wasn’t my problem if they’re being gross. 

When we got in the car he told me i ruined our anniversary for making him sit through that and we should have just left and that he can’t believe I would choose a piece of cheesecake over his comfortability. We argued in the car the whole way home about it and Now we haven’t spoken at all today.

He was 20. Before he died he wrote a letter for me and another for our dad. His letter to me was him apologizing for leaving, saying he loved me, he wanted me to have a good life and things like that. Dad's letter was different. Jamie told dad we always knew he cheated on our mom, that he was disgusted to be his son, that he didn't tell him he was sick because he didn't want dad to fake grieve him like he did our mom, he didn't want dad's tears or anguish, that he felt like dad not getting the chance to say goodbye was justice for his affair, his affair child and for the hell he put the two of us through when we were so young and losing our mom. I only know the content of dad's letter because he told me about it and wanted to know if I felt similar in any way and I told him I did.

My dad had other kids with his wife, the affair partner (or one of them?). My half sisters are 11 and 10 and my half brother is 8. I'm 17M because I know I didn't mention that. And the timeline was mom was sick for like a year. She died when I was 5 and my brother was 8. Dad was a dad again only 6 months after she died and his wife was living with us before that point.

My brother always kept his distance from our half siblings and he wanted no part of being their brother. I feel similarly but I'll try to be nice because we live in the same house. But now that Jamie's gone I feel like I lost my only sibling and I don't love or care about my half siblings or think of them as real siblings.

Which might be why I'm resisting here but anyway. Dad knows I have a letter from Jamie. But Jamie didn't write anything to our half siblings. So dad wants to make a copy of the letter and make it look like it's to all of us (so edit it). He said ever since the girls found out I got one, they've been upset and they grieve for Jamie too and they don't deserve the weight of being unloved by their brother and knowing they'll never get to have a kind message from Jamie. He said Jamie never said I love you to them or hugged them or gave them any of his heart. And it's not their fault. But some of the pain can be eased if they think he thought of them. He said we'll just say I was being possessive of the letter and it was never just mine. I didn't agree to share the letter and I told dad I don't want him to edit it.

He got really mad at me and asked me how I can have such a small age gap between me and my half sister, how I could live with them for 11 years and not want to save them from this. He asked me if I had become such a monster.

And I'll be honest I was never excited or really into the whole blended family thing. But I know that's not my decision.

All three of my stepsiblings have food allergies, two have bad ones. So the way we eat changed a lot. This included places we eat at that were a part of traditions. For most of my life we'd eat at this local noodle bar in town for the end of the school year and whenever we had a school thing (play, graduation, report card, etc) and we're not allowed to go there anymore because of the allergies. Even just with dad it's a no go. We can't bring ice cream into the house anymore because my stepsiblings can't eat it. Only my dad and his wife can prepare food so no more making a sandwich for myself either.

Birthdays have changed. My sister and I can no longer eat at our preferred restaurant of choice because of my stepsiblings and we can't bring my favorite dish into the house either. So now it's a place that my stepsiblings love and ""is acceptable"" for their allergies. For two years dad has talked about how glad we are to make all these changes and how family is worth it.

About four months ago his wife noticed my sister and I weren't engaged with ""the family"" in the way she thought we'd be. We didn't want to talk to her. She also noticed my sister had cut me and her out of some photos of all of us and used just me and her for her room's art wall. So she and dad decided we needed some family therapy.

And my dad has also talked about all the good from a blended family and changes were mentioned and he talks about how happy we all are to make them. Well, last week I got so sick of it and the therapist asked me if I was truly okay with them. And I went off. I said no I'm not. That I hate the changes. That it's unfair. That I never said I wanted my stepsiblings to celebrate my birthday more than I wanted my favorite foods. That these things were decided for me. I said I never would have made that decision because celebrating with them isn't important to me. I'd rather have a good time with the people I love and enjoy food that I love instead. And that I hate not being able to make a sandwich or buy snacks after school. I basically went off for the whole session between a rant and answering questions the therapist put to me.

My dad is so mad at me for doing it and his wife was really upset because her kids heard it. But she was also upset because she accepted on some level I didn't want this ever. She's also kinda mad that I took up a whole session with my rant.

I'll call her Mary. Growing up, we were pretty close, as me and my siblings (20f and 23m) often went to Mary's house. Lately, we haven't seen each other much, because all of them moved away for college, but it's still nice to see each other at family events.

A year and a half ago, she met her now husband. He was invited to Christmas, Easter, and every family event since then. When he was there, I noticed that Mary was a lot more distant than usually and barely talked to me but talked with my siblings all night. I figured it was probably just because of our age difference.

A few weeks/months ago, we got an invitation to their wedding in the mail. Or at least my parents did. My name wasn't mentioned on the invitation, which was addressed to ""The *ourlastname*s"", but since I still live with my parents, and my brother and sister both got one, I assumed I was included, and so did my parents. But Mary's face dropped when she saw me. She pretended to smile but I could see something was bothering her.

The wedding went on, but during the cocktail Mary came up to me and asked me why I came, since she didn't send me an invitation. I was taken aback a bit, but told her that we assumed I was included, and  asked her why she didn't invite me. She avoided the question, but after insisting a bit she told me that she wanted her husband's family to have a good impression of her family, and didn't want them to know that her cousin was a lesbian, because she wanted to have a ""normal family"".

For context, our family is pretty open minded, and all of them accept me, but her husband and his family are a lot more traditional and conservative. What I don't understand is, I don't ""look gay"" (whatever that means), and they would've never known unless someone told them.

I was so shocked. I told her that she was sick for caring about impressing a bunch of bigots more than her own cousin. She got mad at me and we both got a bit loud, which attracted attention. People came to find out what was happening. When they found out, my parents said that she was being mean and shouldn't have made a big deal about this. A bunch of other people said that it was wrong of me to come when I wasn't invited. Mary started telling me to leave, so I stormed off.

Since, I have been receiving texts from her and her parents saying that I was a bitch for coming, making a scene, and ruining her big day. I understand that it's her wedding and she can invite whoever she wants, but her words were so hurtful... And I genuinely thought I was invited. But I know it's wrong that I caused such a scene on her wedding day. Maybe I should've just left and not said anything?

My name wasn't mentioned on the invitation, which was addressed to ""The *ourlastname*s"", but since I still live with my parents, and my brother and sister both got one, I assumed I was included, and so did my parents. But Mary's face dropped when she saw me. She pretended to smile but I could see something was bothering her.

The wedding went on, but during the cocktail Mary came up to me and asked me why I came, since she didn't send me an invitation. I was taken aback a bit, but told her that we assumed I was included, and  asked her why she didn't invite me. She avoided the question, but after insisting a bit she told me that she wanted her husband's family to have a good impression of her family, and didn't want them to know that her cousin was a lesbian, because she wanted to have a ""normal family"".

For context, our family is pretty open minded, and all of them accept me, but her husband and his family are a lot more traditional and conservative. What I don't understand is, I don't ""look gay"" (whatever that means), and they would've never known unless someone told them.

I was so shocked. I told her that she was sick for caring about impressing a bunch of bigots more than her own cousin. She got mad at me and we both got a bit loud, which attracted attention. People came to find out what was happening. When they found out, my parents said that she was being mean and shouldn't have made a big deal about this. A bunch of other people said that it was wrong of me to come when I wasn't invited. Mary started telling me to leave, so I stormed off.

Since, I have been receiving texts from her and her parents saying that I was a bitch for coming, making a scene, and ruining her big day. I understand that it's her wedding and she can invite whoever she wants, but her words were so hurtful... And I genuinely thought I was invited. But I know it's wrong that I caused such a scene on her wedding day. Maybe I should've just left and not said anything?

He did not ever mean a down payment for a home in Colorado, where my wife and I have lived since we were in college. He said he thought I would be “smart enough” to realize that we’d need to move somewhere with a lower COL than Colorado.

He keeps saying ""move to a cheaper city."" Our lives are here. Our friends, our jobs, our hobbies. You can’t exactly leave your house and be up on top of a 14,000ft peak in 6 hours where my family is.

I told him that we had never talked about moving back there, and we never would. That we would rather be stuck renting for a while longer than be stuck somewhere we didn’t want to be, and the “move to a cheaper city” wouldn’t work for us. He said “so be it” and gave us the amount and that was that. I expressed gratitude and thanked him for the money. It is still towards the goal.

Well because of this shift in our finances, we have had to make a lot of changes to save up the rest of the money. We have had to cut out vacations, birthday gifts, holidays, etc. We won’t be traveling home for a few years. At our current rate, we should have an ok down payment by the end of next year (2025).

My Dad confronted us about this because we won’t come for a summer break trip and told me that I was being a selfish, entitled brat because I hadn’t gotten my way. That I was essentially punishing the rest of the family because we “assumed” what his gift would be.

I told him that I was grateful for the amount he gave us, but that it means we do need to buckle down and save every penny if we want to be able to afford a house anytime soon. Even townhouses around us are easily over 400k, and that’s for the sketchy ones.

But is my Dad right? AITA?

**Edit to add FAQ:**

There was no amount formally discussed. He said ""a down payment"" and that was that.

For my siblings, he paid for college. He paid cash in full for my sister's house, it was $317,000. He did not pay for my college.

They are invited to come here anytime, but believe it should be me to go there because I am the one who moved.

He was acting like a high school or college kid or a single 20 something with no kids. He spent more time with friends than with us. His friends were also treating me more like his mom and expecting me to pick him up from their houses when they needed to get on with stuff.

He fought for 50% custody of our kids which he wasn't given and for the first two or three years he had every other weekend and a two week period during the summer with them as well as alternating holidays. He started being more involved and eventually he did get 50% custody. It was at that time I found out he got some woman pregnant and he realized with three kids he needed to get his act together. He ended up with full custody of his third child. Then he met his wife. They have two more children together now. There are two kids in her life, but I don't believe they're her biological children anyway, who she is also partially supporting. Those two kids don't live with them but apparently she/they pay for stuff for this child.

One of our decisions was that as long as our kids were full time students then they would not have to contribute monetarily to the household budget. Obviously they would still have chores and such. If they weren't full time students then they would get a six month grace period after which they had to pay rent and buy their own food. Rent would be equal to 1/4 of full time minimum wage work.

She has been paying the difference out of the money that would normally go into our vacation account and she cut back on her personal spending. But she is pissed that I am doing this. She says I'm an asshole for being financially manipulative.

Am I an awful mom that If he's going to eat what he wants that I am just over making the effort and spending way extra money when he's not even following the diet (I have been begging, trying ,and cooking GF for over 9 mos and have spent thousands trying to find what even I feel taste pretty good alternative). I don't want to be a uncaring person but I feel like I'm wasting time and money that we don't really have when it makes no difference.

Since I found out I was pregnant though, some issues have started to arise. We announced our pregnancy on social media after we told our parents. Sam texted my husband a congrats text and then told him to pass on her well wishes to me. She's been texting him nonstop with baby advice and what she likes to call ""advice for mama"" which includes sometimes relatively targeted jabs at what I should eat.

I told her politely that my mom was planning on hosting it with the help of my sister and that it was a special moment for them and I wouldn't want to take that away. Well Sam ignored that message, because the next day, she came over and insisted we start working out arrangements for the venue.

I told her once again, my mom and sister were hosting it and she told me that she should take her advice and let her plan it because she'd ensure that the baby shower would be better if she planned it particularly because she'd be working on the menu.

Whether it was pregnancy hormones or just bottled up rage, i told her that the jabs she'd been making at me behind my back about my diet during this pregnancy to my husband are really annoying at that no she cannot host this shower and from now on her unsolicited advice was not appreciated especially if she can't say it to my face.

That night my husband's phone blew up with messages from Sam saying that he had no right to show her those messages and they were just supposed to just be health tips because Sam was studying nutritional science and only wanted to help her best friend and ensure a happy baby and life.

About 45 minutes ago, Steven (30ish M), Amy's partner, sent me a series of angry texts (8am on a Monday morning is really not the best time to receive angry texts) saying how Amy spent last night crying about how she didn't get to eat any of her cake and that I took a slice of it only to throw it away and deprive her of her own cake, and that she only cut 8 slices since she knows I don't like coconut, but I took her slice and threw it away to spite her.

I agreed because I love my nieces and nephew, but I made it clear that I needed at least two weeks’ notice because I work long hours, and I’d have to rearrange my schedule.

Fast forward to this past week. I asked my boss for time off, cleared my weekend, and stocked my house with everything the kids would need.

She decided last minute that they were going to a family-friendly resort instead and didn’t need me to watch them anymore. No apology, just, “We’ll do it another time.”

I was frustrated because I had completely cleared my weekend, turned down plans with friends, and rearranged my work schedule for this. I responded by telling her it wasn’t cool to cancel on me last minute like that, especially when I went out of my way to help.

Then, two days later, she called me again asking if I could watch the kids the following weekend. Apparently, something came up with her original plan, and she needed someone to watch them after all. I told her no, I wasn’t available. She got upset and said I was being selfish and punishing her kids for something that wasn’t their fault.

Now she’s mad at me, and my parents are saying I should be more understanding because “things come up when you’re a parent.” I don’t have kids, but I feel like it’s just basic respect to not cancel on someone last minute and then expect them to be available whenever you want.

So, AITA for refusing to watch my sister's kids after she canceled on me last minute?

 I am a (25f) and my husband (27) and I have been together for almost 4 years and we do not have any kids. I had a same-day lumpectomy surgery yesterday. The tumor is not believed to be malignant, but I wanted it out since my mother had breast cancer. My husband got the day off work and drove me. The surgery was delayed for about 3 hours, and my husband was getting impatient. The surgeon finally came in and said she expected the surgery would take an hour. After she left, my husband said he was going to leave the hospital to get lunch when I went under since he hadn’t eaten that day. I wanted him to be able to eat and was trying to be brave, but I really didn’t want to be left when the surgery was only supposed to be an hour, so I asked him if we could pick up food for him on the way home. He gave me the impression he would stay, and I was wheeled away. 

Fast forward to 30 minutes later, I was being shaken awake by a nurse who told me I was sick and she was trying to get in touch with my husband. Apparently, during the surgery, my blood pressure dropped rapidly, and my surgeon was able to get the tumor out in 20 minutes. My BP was 70/30 by the time they got it out, and my lips had turned blue.

I was very sick in my room. I was bleeding through my internal stitches, coming in and out of consciousness, and was vomiting— all the while; my nurse was trying to track my husband down. My surgeon called him, but he did not answer. I’m very thankful for the sweet nurses who took care of me and reassured me. It is the next day now, and I’m very emotional and angry about the whole ordeal. 

My husband did not apologize and has been incredibly defensive about the whole thing. His explanation for leaving was, “I went out and got lunch, and then I was getting gas because I was low from driving your ass around. The surgery was suppose to be an hour. How was I supposed to know your heart could have stopped?”
I told him he had one job which was to stay with me and tell me what the surgeon says. 
I could get over him leaving if he was apologetic or remorseful, but I’m shocked at his words/how little he seems to care for someone he claims to love. 

In his defense, he cared for me last night when we got home but left today after we argued. I’m sure I’m just still really emotional from anesthesia and being a bit dramatic, but I can’t even look at him the same. He is usually attentive and caring, so I am baffled. I’m sure he thought the chances of anything going wrong were slim, but I can’t understand his thought process.

I sat for hours and hours in waiting rooms during all of my mother’s breast cancer procedures and was nervous to even leave for a minute to get food. God forbid I don’t have cancer because I don’t trust him with anything medical now. Anyway, I’m unsure what I hope to get from writing this to strangers.

After their divorce mom remarried almost instantly and relied on her (much older) husband, who died last year leaving everything for his adult kids and almost nothing for her.  

After the death of her second husband, mom moved in with my brother and his wife. She was supposed to look after their kids while they work. This didn't work out and they are kicking her out, which is totally my mom's fault, I told her multiple times this would happen if she continued to act like she did.

Now she wants to move in with me. She's claiming she'd help with the kid (I have a 2yo). I told her no, I saw what happened to my brother and SIL, you caused major issues in their marriage and I will not risk it. After all, you always told us adult children should never live with their parents (yes, we were both kicked out at 18 right after we finished school). She started crying and saying she doesn't have anywhere to go (she has until the end of the month to leave my brother's house). I told her neither did I when she kicked me out at 18 and I went to live on my friends couch but I worked and eventually rented a room so I guess that's what she should do - that's what everyone else does. She asked me to at least pay her rent until she gets back on her feet, I said no, you're a healthy working age person, you should not be freeloading (that's exactly what she told me when I was 18). We had a very big fight but I refused to let her move in or give her money. I'm sure she should still have some from her inheritance and I know for a fact my brother gave her money so I didn't feel guilty at all.  

Now, multiple relatives are texting me, basically saying me and SIL are horrible people.

I told her no, I saw what happened to my brother and SIL, you caused major issues in their marriage and I will not risk it. After all, you always told us adult children should never live with their parents (yes, we were both kicked out at 18 right after we finished school). She started crying and saying she doesn't have anywhere to go (she has until the end of the month to leave my brother's house). I told her neither did I when she kicked me out at 18 and I went to live on my friends couch but I worked and eventually rented a room so I guess that's what she should do - that's what everyone else does. She asked me to at least pay her rent until she gets back on her feet, I said no, you're a healthy working age person, you should not be freeloading (that's exactly what she told me when I was 18). We had a very big fight but I refused to let her move in or give her money. I'm sure she should still have some from her inheritance and I know for a fact my brother gave her money so I didn't feel guilty at all.  

Now, multiple relatives are texting me, basically saying me and SIL are horrible people. Mom's dead husbands son called to scold me, telling me my mom is my responsibility and not theirs so I should do what's right. I do not feel guilty but perhaps that's what makes me the AH? Am I? I do feel bad about people claiming I'm a bad daughter. Mainly because my mother was never a model mom herself, she never put her kids first and was generally disinterested in us unless she needed something.

I remember her, just not amazingly well. When I was 7 my dad started dating again and met Mara. At first I was upset about Mara and my dad dating and didn't want to meet her and gave her a hard time. I told her I didn't want her replacing my mom. She gave me space to let out all my feelings at her and then she reassured me she was not here to take mom's place. She told me she really liked my dad and wanted to really like me too but she didn't have to be my mom for us to like each other. At first I wasn't sure if I believed her. But she won me over and we got along really well. She even lived with us for a year. But when I was 10 dad broke up with Mara and said she wasn't trying hard enough to fill the role of mom for me and I needed a mom. I told him I didn't want another mom and I loved Mara. That she was the best. Mara was blindsided by it because things had been so good and I don't think my dad had said it would be a dealbreaker.

Within a few months he met his wife, Stacey. Stacey was a single mom with a 2 year old daughter. I was 11 by then. Stacey was very on board to be my new mom and I was not. I said it so many times I didn't want a new mom, I wouldn't call someone else mom, I missed Mara and wouldn't give Stacey a chance if she tried to take over mom's place. I was ignored and dad and Stacey got married when I was 12.

After my 16th birthday, which was June, my dad kinda realized I was serious about not wanting a mom and not giving Stacey a chance to be my mom. She has tried so hard too. She has tried to make me love her and her daughter. But I'm not here to get a new mom. I'm not open to it, something dad now knows. It's caused a lot of strain with him and Stacey because Stacey found out I had DMd Mara recently and apologized for dad and thanked her for being awesome and saying I miss her. Stacey said she can't even get me to say I like her. I told her it's because I don't. That I don't like people who don't listen or who think they can make me do things like let them be my new mom. Stacey said she was expecting/promised a family for her daughter. Not this.

Dad pulled me aside a few nights ago and told me he now realizes I was serious about the things I said and he realizes I loved Mara. But that he really wanted the best for me and someone who wouldn't even try to be my mom wasn't it. He told me Stacey would be such a good second mom to me and I could have a sister, if I give this a chance. He said his marriage could end if we can't pull together as a family. I told him he made a dumb decision and I wouldn't fix it for him. I said it was fine if Mara just wasn't the one for him or if their relationship changed. But I loved her because she wasn't my mom. She was someone I could trust and love as Mara. And that my dislike of Stacey wasn't changing and neither was my unwillingness to get a new mom. Dad told me I don't get to speak to him like that. That I was out of line.

When we got to the restaurant Jenn was already there alone. She said she told her boyfriend Blake the time got pushed back 30 minutes because she needed to talk to us alone. Jenn was mad at Blake for not getting her any birthday gifts and only took her out to dinner to a place they go to often. Our parents understood her being upset and she asked if they would try talking to him because she couldn't get Blake to understand how hurtful that was. I asked her if she had given him her usual 'present' for his birthday or last holiday and Jenn said that wasn't important.

For context, my sister's idea of a gift for her partner is lingerie and sex, and only ever that. I don't know about her past relationships but I do know in the 2 years they've been together, I've heard and seen Blake give her gift ideas for him and he winds up buying them for himself after the fact. He's come to Christmas at our house with gifts for Jenn and Jenn always shows up empty handed for him saying she'd give him his present later.

I told Jenn it sounded like she got as good as she gives whereas our parents said I should be concerned someone would be dismissive and vindictive toward my sister. Our parents said they'd think about talking to him based on his behavior when he arrived. So I text Blake that Jenn was setting him up for a lecture. 

He wound up not showing up. Last night Jenn called me angry. She saw my text to him and realized my text was the reason he canceled and accused me of not having her back and she's told our parents I butt into their relationship but I figure she was trying to get us involved in her relationship anyway. I probably could have just stayed quiet but at the time it didn't sit right with me what she was trying to do. AITA?

Mini Update: Thank you everyone for the responses. I wouldn't say my sister is the golden child since we were treated equally growing up, more that our parents are family first no matter what. This is not the first time shes tried getting others to fight her battles, just the furst time she's done it in public and with our parents. I do not know if our parents know her gift giving but it's pretty easy to figure out based on her comments being the same with every boyfriend she's had since high school. And no, I do not have feelings for Blake, I have a boyfriend of my own I love very much.

They are broken up and as some of you guessed, Jenn is blaming me but honestly I wasn't expecting to come through unscathed after I warned him. I got the news from our mother who called earlier to hark on me not backing my sister up against a man who disregarded her wishes on an important day and bailed. I told mom there are times you absolutely do have family's back but when your daughter only ever forwards nature's gift card to her partners on gift giving occasions knowing they've asked for something else and then involves the entire family for getting her process turned around on her isn't it. Instead of agreeing to a public intervention, she should've told Jenn to leave us out if it and keep it between them. Maybe shut down Jenn's 'all men need is sex to be happy' rhetoric years ago and maybe she'd have a son-in-law by now. So that's all that. Thanks again, I think I'm going to go buy some 'just for the hell of it' gifts for my own boyfriend.

I'd have to pay for all of it, they think it'd be a nice gift to my sister. I just laughed and sent them my price sheet, they. flipped. out. I was bombarded with texts from them about how selfish I am, how I am truly vile, how I am toxic for expecting my family to pay for my cake when they could just go to Walmart to get one, etc..

Jojo even messaged me on discord a week after I had sent the price sheet and asked why I would charge her when I made my best friend a free wedding cake. I simply told her to f off as not only was I invited to her wedding, but I was the MOH and in a way it was a ""returning the favor"" for being a genuinely good friend and helping me out when I was going through a lot.

Jay and his wife had said I'm not wrong for it and they'd do the same thing, and my boyfriend is on my side.

They will also be setting up a children's play area. 

My cousin is getting married at the end of August in California at a vineyard. No one in the family is in California so to go I need to get a hotel. Me, my mom, and brother found an AirBNB that relatively close. Also I should mention my husband is posted abroad and won't be coming, I was going to fly to the US for this. 

The invite came out only three weeks ago and we had to scramble to find a place. 

The issue now is that I have a 4 month old baby who only breastfeeds and won't take a bottle. She had to drink from an open cup one time because I needed to take a driving exam and that is the longest she has ever been away from me. 

They just let us know that no children under 12 are allowed. So I told them that logistically I can't come. They suggested that me and my mother go back and forth to the AirBNB to watch the baby and I said it's just too big of a deal. To fly all the way there, pay for an AirBNB and then go back and forth during the wedding. It just doesn't seem worth it, its a lot of effort to do all of that by myself with a small baby. The airbnb and plane are still refundable at this point. 

My cousin is mad that I'm cancelling as they paid per head and can't reduce the amount at this point. I said they can try and find someone else to invite. I said it's his fault that they didn't write the child rule on the invitation. He said I should not be stingy and get a babysitter, I don't know anyone in that area of California and honestly paying for a babysitter on top of an AirBNB and flight is ridiculous to me. He says it standard to not bring children to weddings...

So AITA for cancelling close to the date because I can't bring my baby with me. 

Edits for clarity: Short notice is because bride is pregnant. I live with my husband in Germany where he is posted. Baby already has passport because she is only US citizen.
Because of the shotgun nature the wedding, the invite consisted of a graphic image without particular guest names emailed to the guests. The RSVP system also let me choose up to three people(so I thought that was me, my baby, and my husband). 

Update: Apparently about 30 people have cancelled because of this and that's why they are complaining so much about the costs ","AITA for telling my cousin I can't come to his wedding because of no child ruleFinal Update: They have decided that a child free wedding isn't feasible.

To fly all the way there, pay for an AirBNB and then go back and forth during the wedding. It just doesn't seem worth it, its a lot of effort to do all of that by myself with a small baby. The airbnb and plane are still refundable at this point. 

My cousin is mad that I'm cancelling as they paid per head and can't reduce the amount at this point. I said they can try and find someone else to invite. I said it's his fault that they didn't write the child rule on the invitation. He said I should not be stingy and get a babysitter, I don't know anyone in that area of California and honestly paying for a babysitter on top of an AirBNB and flight is ridiculous to me. He says it standard to not bring children to weddings...

So AITA for cancelling close to the date because I can't bring my baby with me. 

Edits for clarity: Short notice is because bride is pregnant. I live with my husband in Germany where he is posted. Baby already has passport because she is only US citizen.
Because of the shotgun nature the wedding, the invite consisted of a graphic image without particular guest names emailed to the guests. The RSVP system also let me choose up to three people(so I thought that was me, my baby, and my husband). 

Update: Apparently about 30 people have cancelled because of this and that's why they are complaining so much about the costs ",False,False,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my cousin I can't come to his wedding because of no child rule,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1edr1dc/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_i_cant_come_to_his/

I (30F) gave birth to our first child, *Olivia*, two months ago. Being a first-time mom has been both beautiful and overwhelming. My husband, *Jake* (32M), was incredibly supportive during the pregnancy and promised that after Olivia was born, he would be there for me every step of the way, especially during those challenging first few months.

Before Olivia was born, Jake and his friends had been planning a ""bro’s only"" trip for this summer—a week-long vacation to a cabin in the mountains for hiking, fishing, and bonding. When the trip was being discussed, I reminded Jake that Olivia would only be a few months old, and we would be deep in the newborn phase. He reassured me that if things got too tough, he would cancel the trip to help me out, and I trusted him.

Now that Olivia is here, things have been harder than I anticipated. Between the sleepless nights, breastfeeding struggles, and just trying to adjust to motherhood, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed. Jake has been helpful, but I can tell he’s excited about this trip, which is coming up next month.

Last week, I asked Jake if he could consider canceling the trip, reminding him of his promise. I told him that I’m struggling and that having him gone for a whole week would be really tough on me. He seemed surprised and a bit hurt that I was asking him to cancel. He said he’s been looking forward to this trip for months, and that he needs a break, too. He also pointed out that his parents live nearby and could help if I needed support while he was away.

I understand that Jake needs a break and wants to spend time with his friends, but I can’t help feeling like this is a time when I really need him by my side. I tried to explain that while I appreciate his parents' help, it’s not the same as having him here. Jake said that I’m being unfair by asking him to cancel the trip after all the planning that went into it and that I need to trust him to make sure I’m supported even if he’s not physically there.

Now, we’re at a bit of a standoff. Some of my friends think I should let him go, saying that it’s important for him to have some time away, especially after all the stress of becoming a new dad. But others agree that it’s too soon for him to take off for a week, and that he should prioritize being home with me and Olivia.

So AITA for asking my husband to cancel his ""bro’s only"" trip to help me with our newborn after he promised he would?

Hey, everyone. I just wanted to give a quick update after reading through most of the replies. I was honestly overwhelmed by the amount of support and understanding I received—thank you so much to everyone who took the time to respond. Your kind words and thoughtful advice really helped me feel less alone in this situation.

A lot of you suggested that I should also take a week off, letting Jake stay with Olivia, to get a break for myself. I really appreciate the sentiment behind that suggestion, but there are a couple of reasons why it’s not realistic for me right now. First of all, I’m breastfeeding, so being away from Olivia for that long would be really difficult logistically. But beyond that, and this is something I know I need to work on, I just don’t feel comfortable being away from my baby yet. I know it’s not healthy to feel like I can’t have her out of my sight, but I can’t help it. I guess it’s just that new mom anxiety that’s really hard to shake.

I’ve been debating whether or not to show Jake this thread. I’m worried that reading it might hurt his feelings, but I’m definitely going to have another conversation with him about everything. I’m willing to compromise and let him go on the trip, but I think a whole week is just too much. I’m leaning towards suggesting that he limit the trip to a maximum of three nights, so he can still have some time away with his friends but not be gone for an entire week.

I’ll update again after we’ve talked. Thanks again for all the support, everyone. It really means a lot to me.

Also, I'm new to Reddit, not sure if I should be posting updates or just editing this post.

  
UPDATE

Hey, everyone. I just wanted to share another update after having a very long and emotional talk with Jake. I won’t get into every detail of our conversation, but I’ll touch on the most important points.

After putting Olivia to bed, I went straight to bed myself, feeling utterly exhausted. Jake was already asleep, but for some reason, the weight of everything just hit me all at once, and I started crying uncontrollably. My sobbing woke Jake up, and he immediately asked me what was wrong. I told him that I was just tired, but then I opened up about how anxious I’d been feeling about his trip and being left alone with Olivia. I admitted something I’ve been reluctant to say out loud—that Jake hasn’t been as involved as I thought he would be. This was one of my biggest fears when we found out we were having a baby.

For context, Jake has a rocky relationship with his own dad. I won't go into detail about why his dad isn't the best but his mom (my mother-in-law) remarried when Jake was in middle school, and his dad wasn’t very present in his life. Jake has expressed to me before that becoming a father was scary for him because he’s afraid of being a bad one, just like his dad. When he first told me that, I thought it would make him into a great father, because it showed how much he cared about being a good dad long before we were even pregnant.

When I vented to him about all of this, at first, he tried to defend himself. He admitted that he’s been freaking out about having a baby for so long and just didn’t want to tell me. He said he didn’t want to stress me out while I was pregnant because he knows how much I’ve always wanted to be a mother. Hearing him say that made me feel guilty, like I hadn’t seen how much he’s been struggling internally. I had tried to convince him that he was going to be a great dad when we had this conversation long ago, and now it all felt more complicated.

I thought to myself, *This can’t go on much longer.* I realized that if he was going to keep pulling away like this, I didn’t know if I could handle it. So I asked him, “Is this what our life is going to look like from now on? Me with Olivia and you away? Because if it is, Jake, then I don’t think I can continue on like this.”

Jake told me to calm down and assured me that he wasn’t going anywhere. Then he got really emotional—he even started to tear up. He said he didn’t want to turn into his dad, and that he hadn’t realized that going on this trip could be a preliminary step toward becoming the absentee father he feared he might be. He apologized for not considering me and Olivia as much as he should have.

Long story short, Jake called his friends and told them he wouldn’t be able to make the trip. He’s even started planning a little family getaway for the three of us next year when Olivia is a bit older. It was a tough conversation, but I feel like we’re on the same page now, and I’m hopeful that things will get better from here.

I (26M) am getting married to my fiancée,(let’s call her Sarah (25F), in a few months, and I’m super excited about it. But there’s one big issue with all the planning—my mom.

A little background: My parents divorced when I was 8, and my mom (let’s call her Layla) remarried pretty quickly after that. She married this guy, Dave, who had two kids of his own. Ever since, it’s like I was no longer a priority in her life. She focused all her attention on Dave and his kids. Like, I’m not exaggerating when I say she treated them way better than me. They’d go on trips, she’d go to all their sport events, and they’d get everything they wanted. Meanwhile, I felt like I was invisible. She didn’t ask about my school, didn’t care about my friends, or even my mental health. I started to feel like I wasn’t even her kid anymore 

When I turned 18, I moved out. I thought maybe she’d care and try to stay in touch, but nope—she didn’t. I’d text her once in a while just to check in, and she’d either not respond or say she was busy with Dave and his kids. I figured if she didn’t care, why should I? So, I just stopped trying to reach out.

Fast forward to now. I’m planning my wedding, and out of nowhere, my mom starts texting me like we’re super close. She wants to know all the details, saying how excited she is, and even saying things like, “I can’t wait to see you start this new chapter.” Like… seriously? I haven’t heard from her in years, and now she expects to be front and center for my wedding?

I told her straight up that I didn’t want her there. I said I’m not comfortable with her coming after everything that’s happened, and that if she really wants to have a relationship, we can talk about it after the wedding, but not before. She started crying and saying I’m holding a grudge and that “I’m her son” and “she deserves to be there.” But I don’t know how I’m supposed to just forget the fact that she ignored me my whole childhood in favor of Dave’s kids.

Now, my family is split. Some of them think I’m right and that I shouldn’t just let her show up when she never showed up for me. Others think I should just let it go, and “it’s just one day” and that I should let her come to the wedding to keep the peace.

My wife is weird about butt stuff. I'm not talking about sexual butt stuff, that's obviously personal and up to the individual. I mean her unwillingness to acknowledge that anything comes out of butts or that people even have buttholes.

When we bought our house, I wanted to install a bidet, but my wife was against it. I told her she doesn't have to use it but she said just seeing it would gross her out. I mentioned not feeling clean just from wiping with paper and she didn't understand. Not everyone has naturally hairless assholes that barely require wiping! She asked if I could find an alternative. I said I could use wet wipes, but they're not flushable (none of them are BTW) so they'd have to go in the trash. She didn't like the idea of poopy things in the trash can, and told me to figure something else out that she didn't have to know about.

So, onto my ass rag. I took an old towel, tore it up, and installed a discreet hook behind the toilet to hang the rag. It's completely hidden. The way our bathroom is set up (we only have one), the sink is right next to the toilet. So I'm able to wet the rag, clean up, wash it in the sink, and hang it back up. I swap it out a couple times a week. Gross? Maybe. But I figured that's my business since my wife did not want to hear about my butthole cleaning habits.

Recently my wife and I were showering together and she forgot to bring in a washcloth for herself. I don't use one, I use a sisal pouch with bar soap. I offered to hop out and grab her a washcloth, but she said, ""No, don't worry about it, I'll just use yours!"" and reached for my ass rag. I said you don't want to use that. She asked why. I said just trust me. She kept pushing.

So I came clean about my ass rag. She was horrified, started dry-heaving, and kicked me out of the shower. Apparently she had been using it as a washcloth for years whenever she forgot hers, which is often. What I don't get is how she thought that was my washcloth because A) It's hidden behind the frikkin' toilet and B) She knows I don't use a washcloth. We got into an argument. From my perspective, it was obvious that my ass rag wasn't a washcloth, all bets are off when you use someone else's shit without asking, and her butthole hangup is interfering with my personal hygiene. From her perspective, I violated a clear boundary she set years ago and I'm just an overall gross person. I did apologize but I was upset and my apology wasn't really sincere.

I'm sleeping on the couch right now to try and give her some space. But I'd like to know if I owe her a more sincere apology over this ass rag fiasco. I'm really not sure and her reaction has me thinking that maybe I actually am disgusting and I'm lacking the perspective to see it. But I also don't think her butthole aversion is normal, and it's the main reason I ended up resorting to the ass rag solution in the first place and not telling her about it.","AITA for not warning my wife about my ass rag?Okay, context.

I offered to hop out and grab her a washcloth, but she said, ""No, don't worry about it, I'll just use yours!"" and reached for my ass rag. I said you don't want to use that. She asked why. I said just trust me. She kept pushing.

So I came clean about my ass rag. She was horrified, started dry-heaving, and kicked me out of the shower. Apparently she had been using it as a washcloth for years whenever she forgot hers, which is often. What I don't get is how she thought that was my washcloth because A) It's hidden behind the frikkin' toilet and B) She knows I don't use a washcloth. We got into an argument. From my perspective, it was obvious that my ass rag wasn't a washcloth, all bets are off when you use someone else's shit without asking, and her butthole hangup is interfering with my personal hygiene. From her perspective, I violated a clear boundary she set years ago and I'm just an overall gross person. I did apologize but I was upset and my apology wasn't really sincere.

I'm sleeping on the couch right now to try and give her some space. But I'd like to know if I owe her a more sincere apology over this ass rag fiasco. I'm really not sure and her reaction has me thinking that maybe I actually am disgusting and I'm lacking the perspective to see it. But I also don't think her butthole aversion is normal, and it's the main reason I ended up resorting to the ass rag solution in the first place and not telling her about it.",False,False,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not warning my wife about my ass rag?,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cohvxo/aita_for_not_warning_my_wife_about_my_ass_rag/

While they were out, Lauren bought them both dresses she thought were cute. Except she bought Bonnie a size 3. Bonnie said she picked out one that was her size, but Lauren put it back and said that the size 3 one would be her “aspirational” dress to work towards fitting into.

When she came home, she gave it to me and was upset but also didn't want to say anything bad about Gigi's mom, which I get. First off, Bonnie is a HEALTHY girl. Gymnastics until she was about 11 (and grew several inches), dance in the fall and track in the spring, all her choices. So she's got an athletic build. Gigi is a small girl, barely 5 feet, and so I thought at first she got them mixed up. She told me that Gigi’s mom got it for her to aspire to try to get into by “working hard.”

I said I’d take care of it and get her the right size. The next day, I called Gigi’s mom Lauren and asked her why she would do that. She explained that she thought it would give Bonnie something to work towards, because she heard Bonnie saying she didn’t get asked out last year but Gigi had several boys after her and that it seemed like it upset her.

I told her it was inappropriate and asked her why she would tell a kid she needed to lose weight in order to get attention from boys? She got defensive and said that it was obviously embarrassing for Bonnie to not have boys into her when all her friends do.

She basically said I’m holding Bonnie back from growing up—like I won’t help her with boys, won’t drop hundreds at Sephora, still dress her like a kid, and buy B&BW sprays instead of fancy perfumes. She said it’s messing with Bonnie socially and that she’s the only one in her friend group who hasn’t had a boyfriend. Then she got personal and said just because I’ve “given up” and stopped trying doesn’t mean I have to turn Bonnie into a nun.

FOR THE RECORD, this is partially true. But it's also because Bonnie doesn't WANT that stuff. I have offered to get her more than Cetaphil skincare and she doesn't want it. She got straight As last year and I took her to Ulta for a ""spree"" and sall she wanted was some lip gloss and then ASKED for the body spray instead.

I said that it’s time for a break. The girls can still hang out, but I don’t want Bonnie at Gigi’s house. Bonnie got upset over it and I can deal with that. Gigi’s mom however has gone NUCLEAR over it, spreading poison everywhere she can about me being “psycho” and doubling down on how it’s all because I don’t want my daughter to be happy with a boyfriend when I’m single and “no man would touch me.” Which is just… childish.

I’m used to it and usually let it roll off my back. But there’s a new one that’s picked up momentum that I guess stems from a TV show where a girl is putting on a childish act and she says “I’m a very sexy baby” in a cutesy voice and there’s a LOT more to it that you can just Google.

My SIL Cassie has picked this up and has been using this “against me.” I can’t wear a cute outfit without her coming down on me and chiding me for “buying into the whole sexy baby thing” when I am JUST WEARING AN OUTFIT. I’m just trying to be ME. God forbid I wear a shorter skirt or bows or anything I think is cute.

It’s like I’m not allowed to wear cute or sexy things because I’m petite so I’m automatically seen as trying to be a “sexy baby” when I’m not. I’ve asked Cassie to stop or drop it and she maintains that I’m the one opening myself up to judgment and I should dress my age.

This came to a head last weekend when we were in my auntie’s backyard at the pool. I took off my wrap so I could hang with my feet in the pool with my cousins and Cassie immediately said “You’re a very sexy baby” at me and twirled imaginary pigtails.

I raised my voice and said “That’s a really weird thing to keep saying. What is your problem with me? Why do you keep bringing up that I’m small?”

She started to turn red and she yelled back again that I’m the one that’s choosing to walk around looking like the “sexy baby.”

I said that I’m literally just wearing a bathing suit (a one piece halter) and asked her what I should be wearing instead if that’s such a problem.

She yelled back that I should “dress like a grown adult” and to stop trying to cause a scene in front of everyone. I said whatever and just tried to ignore her.

Later on we ended up inside at the same time and she came down on me for calling her out in front of everyone. I told her to stop trying to make me feel bad for being small, that I didn’t choose this body. She rolled her eyes and told me to grow the fuck up, and that “trying to start shit” with her is even more proof.

I am at a loss here and I’m starting to just not want to be around my family because of her. It’s not enough that I get this shit from women at work, at the gym, basically anywhere, now it’s in my family. AITA for calling her out? Or even for just… idk, existing in my own body?

Emily had Lily when she was young (16), and since she was a single mom for most of it, I’ve always tried to help out where I could. Over the years, I’ve paid for Lily’s summer camps, her college applications, and even her first car. I did this because I love them both and always wanted to support them.

A year ago, Lily got engaged to her long-term boyfriend. When they announced the engagement at a family dinner, I said I’d be happy to help with wedding expenses. I never said I’d pay for *everything*, but apparently, my offer was interpreted as me footing the bill for the whole wedding. It became clear when Lily and Emily started planning a big, extravagant affair—destination wedding, 200+ guests, you name it.

I sat them down and said I’d contribute $15,000, which I thought was a pretty generous amount. But they both seemed really upset. Lily said I “promised” to pay for the wedding, and Emily backed her up, saying I “always supported them” and this was the least I could do. Apparently, they were expecting I’d cover a $50,000+ wedding. I told them that wasn’t happening. $15,000 was all I could give.

Now, here’s where things get worse. Lily and Emily stopped including me in the wedding planning entirely. I didn’t hear much from them for a while, and it turns out they booked everything for the wedding thinking I’d *eventually* cave and cover it. Now they’re in over their heads, and the wedding is just three months away. Emily called me, crying, saying they were going to lose deposits and that I “ruined” the wedding by not coming through. Lily isn’t speaking to me.

Here’s the kicker: Emily and Lily are now saying I’m being manipulative, offering to help and then taking it away at the last second, making them look bad in front of the groom’s family. They claim they never would’ve planned something so extravagant if I hadn’t promised to cover it all.

But I never said that. I said I’d *help*. I feel like I’ve done more than enough over the years, but now I’m being treated like the villain for not paying for this giant wedding.

AITA?","AITA for refusing to pay for my niece’s wedding after promising to cover it?So, I'm a 35-year-old guy, and I’ve always been close with my older sister, *Emily* (38F), and her daughter, *Lily* (22F). Emily had Lily when she was young (16), and since she was a single mom for most of it, I’ve always tried to help out where I could. Over the years, I’ve paid for Lily’s summer camps, her college applications, and even her first car. I did this because I love them both and always wanted to support them.

A year ago, Lily got engaged to her long-term boyfriend. When they announced the engagement at a family dinner, I said I’d be happy to help with wedding expenses. I never said I’d pay for *everything*, but apparently, my offer was interpreted as me footing the bill for the whole wedding. It became clear when Lily and Emily started planning a big, extravagant affair—destination wedding, 200+ guests, you name it.

I sat them down and said I’d contribute $15,000, which I thought was a pretty generous amount. But they both seemed really upset. Lily said I “promised” to pay for the wedding, and Emily backed her up, saying I “always supported them” and this was the least I could do. Apparently, they were expecting I’d cover a $50,000+ wedding. I told them that wasn’t happening. $15,000 was all I could give.

My parents were in a ""transitional period"" as my moms parents called it in the weeks prior to his death. What I think that means is they were trying to figure out how to divorce without fucking me up. But I thought it was pretty clear my parents relationship was done. They hadn't seemed happy in so long and I don't remember them being affectionate with each other.

Within a year of my dad dying my mom met ""Harvey"" and they were dating for two years when she introduced me and him. He seemed okay. I wasn't like OMG so excited to have my mom dating someone. But it was fine. Mom asked me what I thought and I told her he seemed okay and she was really happy which was nice. She asked me if I thought he'd make a good bonus dad and I told her I hated how that sounded. We talked and she admitted she wanted to pick someone I could see being the new father figure in my life. She said it didn't have to be an only dad thing but even if I loved someone enough to think of them as a second dad. I told her that wouldn't happen but I'd be fine with Harvey sticking around and being married to her if she wanted that. We went to therapy and Harvey eventually joined us and by the time we were done I was almost 15 and they were married and mom was pregnant.

My mom had two kids in the last 18 months. My half brother is 17 months old and my half sister is 3 months old. Things were kind of crazy when my half brother was born so mom didn't do any kind of party or celebration of his birth. Since she and Harvey made sure they won't have more kids mom decided to throw a party to celebrate the kids being born.

So this is where I should say that I'm pretty indifferent to the babies. I know they're technically my half siblings. But I don't really feel anything toward them. Honestly it makes me sad that I was the only kid my parents had together because I think it would have been nice to have someone who's been there with me through my parents relationship breaking down, dad dying and mom remarrying and starting a family with Harvey. But I just don't see my half siblings the way I imagine seeing a full sibling, because we only share one parent, because I'm so much older and because our experiences will always be so different. I don't hate them. But I can't honestly say I love them.

During the party for the babies I got kind of tired of faking being happy and enthusiastic about it so I went upstairs for a while and was talking to my best friend. Apparently my mom overheard and she talked to Harvey afterward and was devastated because she has realized I don't feel all warm and fuzzy about the babies and I'm not really happy to have half siblings. She realized I do see them as half and that hurt her a lot because she assumed I would see them as simply siblings. Harvey told me what mom found out and he told me to lie my ass off so mom will think she misunderstood and will go back to being happy. When I said no he told me I'm being so selfish.

I (44F) had major surgery last week. I am home recovering and off work for 2 weeks, with 4-6 weeks recommended before resuming life relatively 'normally'. 

My partner (42M) informed me late yesterday afternoon that his son (13M) was having 5 friends for a sleepover tonight. It's now Saturday where I live. I had no prior knowledge that he'd allowed his son to organise this and it's for no special reason, it's just because. 

I was instantly upset. I asked why he would agree to that not only without speaking to me first but also when I'm just home from hospital and recovering from major surgery. His response was that he didn't think it would affect me and he just forgot to mention it. 

I started crying, saying that I felt so uncared for and that he was being inconsiderate of my healing and recovery. He continued to reiterate that he didn't see how it should affect me and that it wasn't a big deal. 

He suggested that if it bothered me that much, I could go and stay at my Mums for the night. I didn't wait until the next day (today, Saturday), I packed a suitcase and drove myself to my Mums right then. Even though I'm not supposed to be driving yet. 

He has sent messages saying I'm over reacting and that he still doesn't think it's a big deal. I don't understand how he thinks an additional 5 teenage boys in a house with 1 toilet and the living space right next to our bedroom where I'm supposed to be resting and recovering, won't affect me. 

AITA for leaving right away, when in fact, I don't think I should have left at all. I think the sleepover should have been cancelled for another time? 

EDIT TO ADD - Surgery was gynaecological. Removal of one ovary and fallopian tube, along with removal of a 6cm solid mass. 

EDIT 2 TO ADD - I do think (hope) if the Mum's knew I'd just had surgery, especially given it was major Gynecological surgery, that they would have declined the invite. Unfortunately I don't have contact information for any of the parents because the son mentioned is from my partners previous relationship and I have no interaction with that friendship circle.

EDIT 3 TO ADD - My Mum lives only 200 meters up the road. A one minute drive at most. I am still in a considerable amount of pain and medicated, but delayed my then due dose until after I arrived at my Mums. My kids loaded the car. 

EDIT 4 - I have 4 children of my own, 2 are underage and live with us 100% of the time. Partner has 3 children total, 2 are underage and live with us four nights a fortnight. I say I have 4 biological kids and 2 bonus kids. This is because his eldest is technically his step son and also an adult.

My little sister (LS) is pregnant with her first child now and she found out its a boy. When I was over at her house we were talking about her plans for the pregnancy and the baby and she told me she plans to name her son the name of my OS deceased son and keep it a surprise. I can tell she thought it was an honor thing but knowing my OS, she would be devastated if that happened. I told my LS I dont think its a good idea and that our OS would not find it to be sweet and an honor it would hurt her even more. We argued about it and she said that Im being dramatic.


Even though I know it was supposed to be a surprise, I knew my older sister would be even more depressed than she already is if our LS named her son after her deceased son so I went against my LS wishes and told my OS. As I expected she was PISSED. She said it was incredibly disgusting and selfish to do that knowing how fresh it is for her and that she does not want to see a baby with her sons name in the family which I agreed with. She was very grateful that I told her before he was born because she said she doesnt know how badly that would have triggered her. 

She of course confronted my LS and they argued about it for a while, with everyone in our family siding with my OS. My LS called me in tears saying Im the reason that my OS cut her off and isnt speaking to her because shes STILL going to name her son after our nephew even with my OS begging her not to, saying that she doesnt find it an honor and that it would hurt her to see another child named after her deceased one. I told my LS shes a horrible person for still going through with this knowing how much it hurts our OS. She says Im an asshole for telling her since it was supposed to be a surprise at birth and that ""seeing her nephew with her sons name would make her realize its a good thing"" and shes just trying to be a good person and Im an asshole for making them fight. AITA?

","AITA for telling my sister that my other pregnant sister is planning to name her baby after her deceased son, causing her to cut her off?AITA? I have two sisters, im the middle sister. My older sister (OS) lost her son late 2022, so it hasnt even been two years yet. He passed at 6 months due to SIDS. My OS has been mourning him ever since. My little sister (LS) is pregnant with her first child now and she found out its a boy. When I was over at her house we were talking about her plans for the pregnancy and the baby and she told me she plans to name her son the name of my OS deceased son and keep it a surprise. I can tell she thought it was an honor thing but knowing my OS, she would be devastated if that happened. I told my LS I dont think its a good idea and that our OS would not find it to be sweet and an honor it would hurt her even more. We argued about it and she said that Im being dramatic.


Even though I know it was supposed to be a surprise, I knew my older sister would be even more depressed than she already is if our LS named her son after her deceased son so I went against my LS wishes and told my OS. As I expected she was PISSED. She said it was incredibly disgusting and selfish to do that knowing how fresh it is for her and that she does not want to see a baby with her sons name in the family which I agreed with. She was very grateful that I told her before he was born because she said she doesnt know how badly that would have triggered her. 

She of course confronted my LS and they argued about it for a while, with everyone in our family siding with my OS. My LS called me in tears saying Im the reason that my OS cut her off and isnt speaking to her because shes STILL going to name her son after our nephew even with my OS begging her not to, saying that she doesnt find it an honor and that it would hurt her to see another child named after her deceased one. I told my LS shes a horrible person for still going through with this knowing how much it hurts our OS. She says Im an asshole for telling her since it was supposed to be a surprise at birth and that ""seeing her nephew with her sons name would make her realize its a good thing"" and shes just trying to be a good person and Im an asshole for making them fight.

She's all about essential oils, no processed foods, cloth diapers when they were babies, and she's absolutely against anything mainstream. For the longest time I didn’t mind because a lot of it is about healthy living and I want the best for our kids. But things are starting to get way out of control.

The latest issue is that my wife is dead set on homeschooling the twins. She’s convinced that public school is “toxic” and that our kids won’t thrive in a system that’s “designed to make them little robots.” She even has a few friends in her crunchy mom group who homeschool their kids and she’s been talking nonstop about joining their co-op. I’ve expressed my concerns about this from the beginning. I work full-time and I don’t think she realizes how hard it’s going to be to manage homeschooling two kids at the same time while giving them a proper education.

But she won’t hear it. Anytime I bring up public school she shuts it down immediately, saying she doesn't want the twins to get bullied or that we’ll lose control of what they’re learning. I just don’t think homeschooling is realistic and I can’t see how she’ll keep them on any sort of consistent schedule.

I gave her time to prove me wrong over the summer, thinking maybe she’d ease into it and have a plan. Instead, she’s spent most of the time bouncing between different unschooling philosophies and signing them up for random activities with her crunchy mom friends. The kids are constantly bored, and I’ve seen them starting to fall behind.

I'm not proud to admit it but I went behind her back and enrolled the twins in public school for the fall. I told her a few weeks before school started and she absolutely lost it. She accused me of betraying her and said I was undermining her role as a mother. She keeps saying I don’t trust her to raise our kids which isn’t true. I just don’t think she’s prepared to handle homeschooling and I don’t want the twins to suffer because of it.

She spent the whole first week of school trying to make me feel guilty by saying the twins are miserable and that I’ve ruined their childhoods by forcing them into the system. The thing is as far as I can tell the twins actually loved their first week school. They’ve made friends and like their teacher. But my wife keeps insisting they’re just pretending to like it to make me happy.

Now, she’s talking about pulling them out mid-year and starting over with her homeschooling plan but I’m putting my foot down. I want the best for my kids, and I honestly think public school is the right choice for them right now. My wife is making me feel like I’m the bad guy for going behind her back and forcing them into something she was so against.

AITA for enrolling the twins in public school without her consent? Should I have handled it differently? I'm starting to feel really guilty about what this is doing to my wife.

**EDITING TO ADD:**

* Yes the twins are vaccinated. My wife wasn't so far in the crunchy pipeline back then. Her friends do sometimes make her feel bad about that.

* I looked into homeschooling and unschooling and did my research. I had hoped my wife had a plan which was why I gave her the summer to figure that out.","AITA for signing my kids up for public school behind my wife's back?So, I (36M) am a dad to 6-year-old twins, and my wife (28F) is a stay-at-home mom who has recently gone full crunchy mom mode.

Because of her condition she also has some other health problems which disqualify her from adopting due to the uncertainty around her quality and length of life. She was aware for most of her life that she couldn't have biological children. That was discovered when she was still very young but the rest came throughout her 20s. She had dreams of motherhood and had lists of baby names she wanted to use. But she will never be able to use them on children that are hers. What I (28M) did not know at the time was she had saved her baby names and was hoping she would get to name or help name my future children.

My wife (27F) and I are expecting our first child. We haven't announced the sex but my sister thinks we're having a girl and shared her girl names with us. We thanked her and said we (wife and I) would discuss what the name would be at some point. My sister looked upset by the response and she then shared her boy names thinking she got it wrong. We gave her the same response.

My mom suggested a couple of months ago that it would be generous and kind to let my sister have some input. I told her we felt it was better if we named our child ourselves.

My wife and I did look at the list, just to see if we liked any of the names. We did not. Names on the lists included Elizabeth, Hannah, Rosemary and Francesca for girls and James, Edward, Patrick and Michael for boys. Those just aren't to our preference. None of them were and there were more names.

My sister mentioned the names again recently and she said we should pick Elizabeth for a girl and Michael for a boy. She said that's what she'd do if she were having the baby. I told her we hadn't made our mind up yet but were still in discussions about it. She offered to help and I said no thanks, my wife and I want to figure it out between us.

I told her I understood that was hurtful to her but she does not get a say. I also asked her to please stop bringing it up. My sister told me I could let her have at least a little say in this and I said sorry but no.

She cried to mom, who thinks we should be more sensitive, while my dad told my sister I wasn't wrong and she needs to accept that she doesn't get to name our baby. My response has caused a divide among my parents and sister and me. It has been made clear my mom thinks I lack compassion and my sister believes I'm hurtful to her.

Shane remembers them fighting a lot back then. I remember none of it. What I do remember is my dad would always stay far away from mom and would sometimes skip things if mom was going to be present. He'd tell me or Shane, or both of us, that he didn't want to be mom's friend so thought it would be easier to stay away. When I was 6 dad met Kim and within 4 months Kim and her daughter Lilah (now 13) moved in with him. Within the next 3 years dad and Kim had my two half siblings, got married in between and Kim moved her mom in to care for her until she died. So it was chaos. Dad also lost his job and made less at his new one.

Shane and I were back and forth between mom and dad. We'd spend a week with mom and then a week with dad. We hated going back then though because it was so chaotic.

Mom was the stable parent for us. She was able to afford to give us a good quality of life that dad struggled to provide. Mom paid for an extra curricular activity for me and Shane each. She made sure we always had enough supplies for school. She bought us nice gifts (we had game consoles at mom's and other stuff that we didn't have at dad's). Over time as Lilah got a little bigger and so did our half siblings, dad and Kim started asking mom to send them money for us or to buy stuff for Lilah and our half siblings too. Mom refused. Dad and Kim hated that. 

They tried to say mom was okay with us suffering and grandma especially said mom should be making sure we didn't feel bad because we had more. Shane and I never felt bad. We knew we had different things because our mom was mom and Kim was our half siblings and Lilah's mom. So different families and different households too. I never felt guilty that we did so well with mom. I never felt like she owed my half siblings or Lilah gifts or food or clothes. Grandpa used to say him and grandma should do more since they were actually family and our mom wasn't and I agree with that. I know Shane does too.

A lot of stuff happened since but a few months ago mom brought me and my two best friends to a concert. Dad knew I was going and he told Kim and Lilah about it, knowing Lilah had wanted to go as well but they couldn't afford it. This became a really big deal. Lilah got so mad at me for it and my dad and Kim got mad at mom because I didn't apologize to Lilah. They said mom put me in the middle of divorce stuff. Then a couple of days ago they were talking about it with grandma and all three said mom made me feel bad by putting me (and Shane) in the middle and making us watch our other siblings suffer while we did so well. Grandpa called them crazy. I told them mom never put me in the middle, they did, and she never made me feel bad for having more because I never felt bad. I knew that comes with having different families. They told me to stop defending mom. Grandpa told them to stop acting like Shane and I need to hate our mom because they do.

Basically I (52F) have three daughters, Anne (30F), Carrie (26F) and Jane (20F). All fake names.

When all my girls turned 18, I made them a special blanket. I then made three swaddle blankets out of the same materials for their future children. Carrie told me not to because she didn't want kids. I found out later it was because she's a lesbian. I said okay, but made them just in case.

Earlier this year, Carrie married her lovely wife, Rory (28F). Her amazing daughter Diane (5F) is my third grandchild. I approached Rory and asked if I could give her one of the blankets I made for Carrie's kids, or if she wanted me to make one special for her out of the materials I used to make their wedding living room blanket. I always give these out on the day they're born, so for Diane I plan on giving it on her birthday and was explaining that to her. She told me to ask Diane. I did, and Carrie overheard.

I found out that she's pregnant because she was crying and yelling that I didn't respect her wishes so how can she trust me with her baby? I'm just so confused and hurt. I was trying to do something nice for all my girls, and then my sweet Diane. Instead of being happy I was cautious, Carrie is threatening to go low contact because I don't respect her and am obviously homophobic because how else would I have thought she'd get pregnant, which is very confusing. Rory is telling me it's hormones and that Carrie is emotional because of how hard it was to get pregnant (I didn't know they had been trying) and that she's afraid she's going to lose it.

AITA? I was trying to be kind. I wasn't being homophobic or trying to be disrespectful.

Edit: I don't know if it's relevant, but I still have material from the blankets for patching, so I was planning on adding to Diane's to make it big enough to use or I was going to let her have it fit her baby dolls. That's what my other two granddaughters do now that it's too small for them.

For context, I (28F) attended a family dinner with my mom, dad and sister (26F) yesterday. My sister is due to give birth soon and decided this dinner would be the perfect time to announce the name she chose for her first child

My sister has always been obssesed with aesthetics, her whole house is beige and rather depressing if im honest. The whole nursery she built for baby is beige and grey and will not accept colourful gifts for the baby. I can tell her husband hates it but he won't admit it.

Now here is the issue, i am very prone to laughing at inappropriate times. I am autistic and find it hard to filter what I say and my emotions, which can lead to me reacting to things in ways that can offend people. I didn't think this would cause issues, until she revealed the name of her baby

So, we are all done with our dinner, we are looking at my sister as announces her baby will be named..

And then i burst out laughing, and said 'You cannot be serious'

I am now banned from all family dinners

Is the name really that bad? Was I really a massive asshole?

After writing this post I decided to call my sister and apologise, as when i wrote down what happened i did realise what a dick move that was. I said I was sorry for laughing and I apologised for using my mental disability as an excuse and offered to treat her to lunch as an apology

Understanably she was reluctant to forgive me, but she did which i am thankful for. She said she was hurt by my actions which I understood but was willing to look past it.

34m here Im not sure how to start this so I'll just get right to it. My wife surprised me with a gift that when presented I didn't really have the best reaction.  

My wife had the day off and wanted have a day with her friend to watch bridgerton and drink momosas. Since she was having her day with her girlfriend, I decided to get a couple rounds of disc golf in . I get off of work and do the daily chores. (Garbage, walk dog, feed mysel) As I am leaving to walk the dog I tell the wife that I'm going to play disc golf after I'm done. To which she replies ""well maybe you shouldn't. I'll tell you when you get back"". This already kind of dampened my mood as I had a long day and getting some light exercise in some clear weather sounded quite nice. Not to mention I've made said plans with a couple people which now I may have to cancel. Not the biggest deal right? 

Now thats out of the way here's the meat and potatoes. She got me a grill and not only that I have to now go pick up said grill, assemble it and prepare dinner for guests because it's nice out she invited friends over for me to cook for. It was presented in manner of ""I got you a grill and invited our friends over and when you get it put together you can use it."" Needless to say my internal self was screaming and the stress meter moved up a bit. I gave a ""oh cool"" and tried my hardest not to seem ungrateful but the surprise seemed very impulsive and just created a ton of work for me to do. So i cancelled my plans.  wife cancelled the pick up order due to my ""ungrateful attitude"". We are now going to go out to eat with said people and we are now in a fight.

Mom remarried when I was 11 and my siblings were 9 and 8. Her husband was divorced, had two kids who were 8 and 6. He had primary custody of them but in the summer they'd get longer with their mom. My mom and her husband moved in together a month before the wedding. From that point on they created these really strict, really weird, and really crazy rules that basically made sure we were never a blended family and there was always animosity.

Those rules were;   
If you want permission for something, ask your ""new parent"", not the regular one  
No bio siblings only playing, everyone has to mix  
No closed bedroom doors. We wanna see if you're mixing  
Every day you'll tell the people in the family one thing you love about them  
You must give everyone hugs before leaving the house  
No step/half nonsense in this house

There were others. Those were the most damaging ones. My mom told me she wanted us to be a happy blended family and she did not want favoritism of parents or siblings. She told me I didn't just have a brother and sister anymore, I had two of each. I also had a ""second dad"".

They enforced this too, or tried to. The hugs never took off and I never ever told her husband or his kids stuff I loved about them. I never loved them to begin with.

The rules led to fighting, to us pretty much causing chaos if they took us places. We were all grounded pretty much all the time at their house. We also started doing stuff to make sure family vacations couldn't happen together. Her husband's kids would make plans with their mom to go to her weeks he and mom had a vacation booked for. My siblings and I would ask dad to book his vacation first and put it in their app. 

My mom and her husband would get so frustrated and they'd try giving us these talks. Mom would come to me and say I was the oldest and needed to set an example. And now that I no longer go to mom's house, my siblings don't want to either and make a bigger deal out of it. Mom called me yesterday and told me I needed to help create the family unit they fought so hard for before it's too late. She mentioned me being the oldest again and how I should be there for a week when we can all be a family. I told her no, I don't want to, and we're not a family. I told her they fucked up. They need to admit it and they need to find a way forward because none of the kids they set so many rules for want to be family.

It gets in the way when I want to quickly eat, when I come home from work hungry and tired and want to grab a quick bite it’s frustrating.

Tara also escaped from her little midwestern hometown and ran to the coast the absolute moment that she could, and I am pretty sure her mom took that personally. (her mom was born and raised in and around that small town)

So my MIL. She is emotionally immature. Tara read that one book about immature adult parents and she finally understood her family dynamic in a way she never did before. MIL is not a bad or evil person, she usually means very well, but she's kind of, I don't know how to put it, self-centered?

Tara and I bought a little starter home last year (fuck interest rates but we're hoping they come down and we can refinance, the place was too good to pass up) and her MIL invited herself over last week. This is something that is extremely on brand for her, and we like to pick our battles in this family, so we just let her. 

Her mom (who again is not terrible, just has bad emotional regulation and boundaries) shows up and drops her stuff in the spare room and just immediately starts giving herself the tour. Again, whatever, we actually hired a cleaner before she arrived so we wouldn't worry, annoying but that's life.

So she's wandering around and comes to our bedroom.

And I respond, ""oh that's for chapped lips, I don't jerk off with vaseline.""

Apparently my timing was good because my wife laughed but my MIL did not laugh at all. Then for the next three days she kept asking me ARE YOU GONNA BE GROSS AGAIN when I tried to make normal conversation. I said over and over that she was the one who made the joke and her response was always ""yeah but that was a JOKE!"" like what I said was totally serious? And I guess it was, I mean, I was telling the truth, but I was only bantering because she started it. I didn't even invite her into our bedroom.

The issue is that she doesn't do much compared to her husband. He takes the kids to school in the morning. The kids have come home on the bus in the afternoon. She has a whole day with no kids that she can do whatever she wants. Maintaining the house is like 2 hours a day. That leaves her with abut 6-7 hours of just being there.

Anyways, she came over yesterday and was ranting. They got into a argument about her picking up more slack or getting a job. I guess this started because he came home to a dirty house and no groceries in the fridge. I asked why she wasn't doing chores or at least getting food and she told me she didn't have time.

I asked if she got a work job and it was a no. I asked what she is doing all day and gave me no answer. She then went on a rant about how he isn't doing enough and her husband is being unfair.

At this point I had enough, I told her she isn't a martyr to be a stay at home mom. That she literally gets everything paid for and can't even both to get food. I told her if I was her husband I would divorce her since she acts more like a kid than a partner

This started our own argument and she is pissed. I personally thinks she needed to here it

Understandably it has been a huge adjustment for both of us. She’s still not sleeping through the night and we’re both back to work full time. We have always split the household responsibilities 50/50. We just help where needed and it’s always worked out well. 

Lately, my husband has been doing the chores terribly and I’ve had to come behind him to fix things or clean them again. For example, he cleaned the bottles the other night and they were cleaned so poorly I had to do them again. He dropped pump parts down the disposal and then ran it ruining them. There have been several clothes that he didn’t clean after a blowout that are now ruined. There are many more instances like this. I’ve confronted him a few times letting him know we all make mistakes and I know we’re both tired but it feels like he’s not even trying to do things well. He just keeps saying he’s so tired and is having a hard time working and taking care of the house and baby.  I do sympathize with this as I’m also working, pumping, recovering, and taking care of the house and baby. 

The final straw for me was when he told me to go to sleep and he’d put up the milk I’d just pumped and finish the dishes. I was so grateful until I got up and realized the milk had been sitting on the counter and at this point was no good anymore. He said he was sorry and he put on a show to relax for a bit before doing the dishes and fell asleep. The next day I decided to cancel all of our streaming services, PlayStation plus, and our theme park passes in order to hire a housekeeper. I figured if he’s too tired to do basic household chores than a housekeeper is necessary. If he’s too tired to put milk up, then he’s too tired to play video games or for us to go to a theme park. We still have cable and the PlayStation games and can do other activities outside of the local theme park. He blew up at me and said I had no right doing that and was furious. I thought I was doing us a favor so we can get more sleep and not worry as much about household tasks. So AITAH for hiring a housekeeper without asking? 

Edit to add: I see a lot of comments about communication. I have been communicating NONSTOP about my needs and my expectations. Ive let a lot of mistakes slide because I know this is hard for both of us, but when it became a daily thing I let him know if he’s unable to do his part, then I need additional help. I mentioned hiring some help, and he laughed and said “what a ridiculous waste of money.” I knew if I asked again, the answer would be no, so I made the decision for both of us. 

Also, I didn’t throw away the tv or PlayStation. I just cancelled our subscriptions for them. We were paying around $100 between the two. Our internet includes a handful of cable channels and peacock and we have plenty of PlayStation games that we can still play. We both play video games and watch tv. I probably watch more on steaming so cancelling them affects both of us.

Housekeeping is $300 a month and everything I cancelled including Disney passes is about $230 so it won’t be as much of a financial burden. Plus it will save more money as well since I won’t have to replace destroyed pump parts, clothes, and breast milk. 

Update: 
It’s been a few weeks of having the house keeper and I’ve had some time to read your replies and think. When I made this post, I really had convinced myself I was trying to save money and help us out but I know now that I was being inconsiderate and petty. I knew cancelling the steaming services would set my husband off a bit. We’ve talked a lot and I’ve apologized and he’s been gracious enough to forgive me and has apologized too.

If you’re newly postpartum, give yourself and your spouse a little extra love and patience. ","AITAH for cancelling all of our streaming services to hire a housekeeper without asking my husband firstMy (28f) and my husband (30m) just welcomed our first baby almost 3 months ago. Understandably it has been a huge adjustment for both of us. She’s still not sleeping through the night and we’re both back to work full time. We have always split the household responsibilities 50/50. We just help where needed and it’s always worked out well. 

Lately, my husband has been doing the chores terribly and I’ve had to come behind him to fix things or clean them again. For example, he cleaned the bottles the other night and they were cleaned so poorly I had to do them again. He dropped pump parts down the disposal and then ran it ruining them. There have been several clothes that he didn’t clean after a blowout that are now ruined. There are many more instances like this. I’ve confronted him a few times letting him know we all make mistakes and I know we’re both tired but it feels like he’s not even trying to do things well. He just keeps saying he’s so tired and is having a hard time working and taking care of the house and baby.  I do sympathize with this as I’m also working, pumping, recovering, and taking care of the house and baby. 

The final straw for me was when he told me to go to sleep and he’d put up the milk I’d just pumped and finish the dishes. I was so grateful until I got up and realized the milk had been sitting on the counter and at this point was no good anymore. He said he was sorry and he put on a show to relax for a bit before doing the dishes and fell asleep. The next day I decided to cancel all of our streaming services, PlayStation plus, and our theme park passes in order to hire a housekeeper. I figured if he’s too tired to do basic household chores than a housekeeper is necessary. If he’s too tired to put milk up, then he’s too tired to play video games or for us to go to a theme park. We still have cable and the PlayStation games and can do other activities outside of the local theme park. He blew up at me and said I had no right doing that and was furious. I thought I was doing us a favor so we can get more sleep and not worry as much about household tasks. So AITAH for hiring a housekeeper without asking? 

Edit to add: I see a lot of comments about communication. I have been communicating NONSTOP about my needs and my expectations. Ive let a lot of mistakes slide because I know this is hard for both of us, but when it became a daily thing I let him know if he’s unable to do his part, then I need additional help. I mentioned hiring some help, and he laughed and said “what a ridiculous waste of money.” I knew if I asked again, the answer would be no, so I made the decision for both of us. 

Also, I didn’t throw away the tv or PlayStation. I just cancelled our subscriptions for them. We were paying around $100 between the two. Our internet includes a handful of cable channels and peacock and we have plenty of PlayStation games that we can still play. We both play video games and watch tv. I probably watch more on steaming so cancelling them affects both of us.

Housekeeping is $300 a month and everything I cancelled including Disney passes is about $230 so it won’t be as much of a financial burden. Plus it will save more money as well since I won’t have to replace destroyed pump parts, clothes, and breast milk. 

Update: 
It’s been a few weeks of having the house keeper and I’ve had some time to read your replies and think. When I made this post, I really had convinced myself I was trying to save money and help us out but I know now that I was being inconsiderate and petty. I knew cancelling the steaming services would set my husband off a bit. We’ve talked a lot and I’ve apologized and he’s been gracious enough to forgive me and has apologized too. I told him about this post and we’ve had some good discussions and laughs from it. He was really hurt by all the “weaponized incompetence” comments and assured me over and over that it was not on purpose but he admitted that he may have been a bit lazy.

So today I was on the streetcar, and it was nearly empty—about 20 seats were available. I was sitting by the window, and this random stranger decided to sit right next to me. Naturally, I’m thinking, “Why sit right beside me when there are so many empty seats?” So I said, “Why did you sit next to me? There are so many other seats open. It’s just a little strange.” The guy shot back with, “Do you own this seat? I can sit wherever I want, you’re being unreasonable.” I told him, “Sure, I don’t own the spot. I just don’t get why you’d pick the seat right beside me when there are plenty of others.”

He basically repeated his point, and at that point, I decided to just get up and move because I didn’t want to escalate things. But in my mind, it felt like an unwritten rule of public transit that if there are lots of empty seats, you sit by yourself.

She gets REAL into it and every 5th or so post is one of those memes about being the ""cool"" place to crash. Or that she wants to be the house where all the kids can just walk in and grab a soda. She has her kids' friends call her Momma K. Whatever.

Recently we were talking on the phone and she cursed and said, ""Not again,"" and said she had to be quiet so no one knew she was home. She then ranted about her neighbors who yell and scream all the time, and their daughter who we'll call ""Annabell"" (7). I guess Annabell and Kimantha's daughter ""Petal"" (8) are friends. Annabell comes over every day (or tries to), rings the bell and sits on the porch if they aren't home, etc. Kimantha said when Annabell comes over she's always asking for food and Kimantha feeds her most days. Kimantha said that Annabell's older sister ""Betty (15?)"" refuses to go in the house when the Dad is home (she will even sleep on their porch!). To me, this screams that these girls are at the very least food insecure,  likely neglected, and possibly abused.

Kimantha said that she was just done dealing with someone else's kid. I laughed and said, ""Ha, so much for all those Facebook posts, eh?"" Oh...was she pissed. She asked me what I meant and I said that she posts about being the ""cool mom"" and the place all the neighborhood kids could crash but then when someone actually seems to need that safe place...she's hiding in her bathroom and pretending she's not at home. I said that I guess she's not really the kind of mom she says she is.

She. Went. Mental. Screaming at me about how I don't know anything. Granted, Kimantha said that she'd be fine with it if the girl didn't ""bully"" Petal in school. I asked her what Annabell had done to bully Petal, and she said that occasionally Annabell doesn't sit with Petal at lunch and one time kicked mulch at her during recess. To me, these didn't sound like bullying but like, typical playground conflicts...and frankly a pretty weak excuse and I told her so.

Anyway, Kimantha isn't talking to me currently and keeps sending me hateful texts about not knowing anything about kids. While I 100% don't think she's RESPONSIBLE for dealing with Annabell, I do think she's being an asshole for saying she's ""that kind of mom"" online, but then...not actually doing it when it's happening in real life? So...AITA? >!​!<

  
Edit: I did ask during the call if she had called CPS on the parents. Kimantha said she doesn't have enough evidence to make a report. I told her that sleeping outside rather than inside because the dad was home WAS evidence and she told me to shut up and not tell her what to do. I also live 3 states away and don't know any of the addresses or even the streets that Betty/Annabelle live off of so I don't actually think I CAN call CPS as all I have is a 3rd hand conversation as evidence and no specific location.

A few months ago Sue asked both me (60F) and my sister June (53F) to be bridesmaids. I was touched, as I have only met Sue a few times (they live in another state). Besides myself and June, there are four other bridesmaids, all under 30.

When Sue sent me the link for the bridesmaid dress, I was horrified. I’m sure the dress will look lovely on her young friends, but I would not want to be seen wearing it in public. It’s super sexy - plunging neckline, thigh-high slit, so clingy that it would reveal every lump on my rump. Please understand that I am not a prude. I am reasonably fit, and I enjoy dressing up, but I AM 60 yrs old. I would not be comfortable showing that much skin at a formal event with all of our relatives present.

I called Sue and nicely asked if there’s a more modest version I could wear. She insisted this was the dress she wanted all her bridesmaids in. She wouldn’t budge, and not wanting to cause family strife, I didn’t push it. (June doesn't like it either, but she's a marathon runner so she can pull it off!)

So I ordered the dress several sizes too large. I took it to a seamstress and had her take it in so it fits, but doesn't cling so tightly to my backside. Using some of the extra fabric she fixed the neckline so it doesn’t reveal so much boobage. And she lowered the height of the thigh slit to a few inches above my knee, rather than nearly to my panties. The adjustments are very subtle and hardly noticeable. It actually looks great on me now.

When Sue heard I’d had the dress altered, she flew into a rage! She texted me that she does not want a “chopped up dress” in her wedding pictures. I sent her photos of me wearing it, but she’s not having it. Joe called and told me that I’ve been “disinvited” from the wedding party, and they have replaced me with another friend.

I thought they didn’t want me at the wedding at all, so I cancelled my hotel reservation (I hadn’t bought my plane ticket yet). Clearly I’ve upset Sue, and I don’t want there to be conflict on her big day. Plus, I’m afraid there would be awkward questions about why my sister is a bridesmaid and I am not. It seems to me it would be less awkward for them to respond to any questions about me with vague “she was unable to make the trip” answers. I’m also not keen on spending more money on this event where I don’t really feel welcome. I’ve already dropped several hundred on the dress, alterations, and matching shoes. 

I let Joe know I still am very happy for him and will of course send them a generous wedding gift. But he said they DID want me there, and now he’s not speaking to me at all, and Sue is telling June that I “ruined” her wedding.

I’m the only one in my family with kids—two young ones, ages 4 and 6. My siblings don’t have children, and my parents are retired. Recently, my sister moved into a new house and decided she’s hosting family gatherings with a new rule: no kids allowed.

She claims her house isn’t “kid-proof” and wants more “relaxed” events. She framed it like she’s doing everyone a favor, but let’s be honest—it’s just my kids, so this rule is clearly aimed at me. It’s hurtful because these are family dinners and holiday get-togethers we’ve always celebrated together as a family. Now suddenly, my kids aren’t welcome?

What bothers me most is how this will affect my children. My 6-year-old adores his extended family, and if he finds out he’s being excluded, it would break his heart. I’m worried he’ll never get over it. How do I explain to him that he’s not wanted at these family events? It could create a rift between him and the rest of the family. He’s sensitive, and I don’t want him growing up thinking he’s not important.

When she told me about her “no kids” rule, I said I wouldn’t attend if my kids weren’t invited. She accused me of overreacting, but if this becomes the norm, what happens for holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas? Am I supposed to leave my kids at home every time?

The rest of my family is siding with her, telling me to just “go along with it” and leave the kids at home for a few hours. My parents, who don’t have grandkids from my siblings yet, think it’s no big deal. They’re even pressuring me to cut my sister some slack since she had a tough time buying her house. But where’s the consideration for me and my kids?

To top it off, my other sibling, who’s childfree, said, “Maybe this is good for you—you could probably use a break.” Great advice from someone who’s never had to juggle parenting while trying to stay connected to family.

AITA for refusing to attend her gatherings and calling her out? I feel like I’m being forced to choose between being part of my family or being a parent.","AITA for refusing to attend my sister’s “no kids” family gatherings because I’m the only one with children?

Hi Reddit, I turned 18 (female) yesterday but it seems to caused a bit of drama in my family so im asking for honest, objective opinions on whether im wrong. I’m using a throwaway account because this situation is obviously very humiliating for me

For reference, my weight has always been made fun of in my family. My aunt specifically has always been very unkind and fat shamed me, even when I was younger and struggling with my body image. She used to tell me that my clothes looked so small on me, and that even her clothes are probably small for me. She used to remind me to go on diets constantly. Im currently 320lbs if it adds contexts too 

I hadn’t seen my aunt in a while and for the most part I was really glad to see her for my birthday. I was slightly dreading if she would say anything to me because im aware I have gained a lot of weight since I last saw her, but she just made a few comments so I thought it was the end of it. 

I was opening a birthday card she gave me a few hours later and it had money in it, with a note that said “money for weight watchers, make some real change for once”. This was humiliating and I asked her about it and she said that she could tell I was miserable and that I probably look really good underneath the fat. She said this in front of my parents, and it was very embarrassing. I told her im not accepting the gift and she’s making me look stupid, but she said that she was just worried for me and my health. I don’t believe this, she’s made fun of my weight for years even before I was a teenager. But my parents think I was overreacting and I should’ve just accepted it. My aunt has a notoriously big mouth and my parents think she’s going to tell our whole family so they’re getting kind of worried about what I’ve done.

For context, one thing our friend group does is ‘trade’ services. For example, I’ll do one of my friend’s nails for free and she’ll do my hair for free when I need it doing in the future. We generally try to keep the trades within the same price range. For example, if my hair costs £60, I’ll trade doing nails for £60-£70. Anything over £10 is usually paid on top of the free service (if my hair costs £60 and the nails are £100, my friend will pay me £40).

To be clear, there is ZERO obligation to do these trades and to my knowledge, no one has been pressured into one. It’s all about favours and doing nice things for your friends.

Anyways, Jane joins the group 2ish months ago and immediately starts asking about my nails. At one point, she says she can’t afford to get hers done right now so I asked her if she wanted to do a trade. Jane makes her own t shirts/clothing/accessories. The nails I ended up doing on her cost £160. When it was my turn to pick clothes/accessories, I ended up leaving with about £70 worth. I told her not to worry about ‘paying’ me back with the £90. All in all, I thought it was a good experience and I got to talk to Jane one-on-one. It was fun.

Until Wednesday (the 11th of December). I get a text from Jane apologising and saying she realised she can’t afford to just ‘give away’ £70 worths of her stuff and she needs me to pay her asap or she needs the stuff back. At first, I’m really confused because I could not have been more clear about the how the trades work and I never forced her into one. I apologised back to her but said I didn't have some of the smaller items as I planned to gift them to my sister for her birthday. Jane then kept telling me to just 'pay her back'. I said I would when I get paid from my job.

The issue then became her texting. She went to our group chat to complain about me not paying her for the clothes she gave me. She ended up letting it slip it was a trade and everyone told her she can't back out of a deal weeks after it happened. She ended up taking to tiktok to complain about how I 'stole' from her and am refusing to pay her back. In response, she was kicked out of the friend group.

However now the group is split. Half say I should have just paid her as she does seem to be genuinely struggling, while the other half say I am under no obligation to pay her due to the agreed terms of the trade. The first group think I'm kind of an asshole and Jane definitely thinks I am... so AITA?

EDIT: some people are questioning how my nails cost £160. I do custom sets that involve hours of art/'construction' (of charms, stamps, etc).

For context, one thing our friend group does is ‘trade’ services. For example, I’ll do one of my friend’s nails for free and she’ll do my hair for free when I need it doing in the future. We generally try to keep the trades within the same price range. For example, if my hair costs £60, I’ll trade doing nails for £60-£70. Anything over £10 is usually paid on top of the free service (if my hair costs £60 and the nails are £100, my friend will pay me £40).

To be clear, there is ZERO obligation to do these trades and to my knowledge, no one has been pressured into one. It’s all about favours and doing nice things for your friends.

Anyways, Jane joins the group 2ish months ago and immediately starts asking about my nails. At one point, she says she can’t afford to get hers done right now so I asked her if she wanted to do a trade. Jane makes her own t shirts/clothing/accessories. The nails I ended up doing on her cost £160. When it was my turn to pick clothes/accessories, I ended up leaving with about £70 worth. I told her not to worry about ‘paying’ me back with the £90. All in all, I thought it was a good experience and I got to talk to Jane one-on-one. It was fun.

Until Wednesday (the 11th of December). I get a text from Jane apologising and saying she realised she can’t afford to just ‘give away’ £70 worths of her stuff and she needs me to pay her asap or she needs the stuff back. At first, I’m really confused because I could not have been more clear about the how the trades work and I never forced her into one. I apologised back to her but said I didn't have some of the smaller items as I planned to gift them to my sister for her birthday. Jane then kept telling me to just 'pay her back'. I said I would when I get paid from my job.

The issue then became her texting. She went to our group chat to complain about me not paying her for the clothes she gave me. She ended up letting it slip it was a trade and everyone told her she can't back out of a deal weeks after it happened. She ended up taking to tiktok to complain about how I 'stole' from her and am refusing to pay her back. In response, she was kicked out of the friend group.

However now the group is split. Half say I should have just paid her as she does seem to be genuinely struggling, while the other half say I am under no obligation to pay her due to the agreed terms of the trade. The first group think I'm kind of an asshole and Jane definitely thinks I am... so AITA?

EDIT: some people are questioning how my nails cost £160. I do custom sets that involve hours of art/'construction' (of charms, stamps, etc).

However, after announcing our engagement, Sarah became cold towards me. Tom later told me that Sarah was upset, feeling like I “stole her spotlight” by getting engaged before their wedding.

A week later, Tom and Sarah called me and said that, because of the “timing” of my engagement, it would be “best” if I stepped down as a bridesmaid. Sarah wanted the focus on her, and apparently, my new engagement was “too distracting.” I was hurt but agreed to step down to keep the peace.

Here’s where things escalated: Tom recently asked if I was still willing to help cover the wedding costs I had previously offered to pay for (a significant amount). I was shocked! I politely declined, saying that I didn’t feel comfortable contributing anymore since I was no longer in the bridal party and felt hurt by the situation.

Tom got really upset and called me selfish, saying I’m ruining his big day. Sarah even accused me of “holding a grudge” and trying to punish them.

A few years ago, my sister-in-law (F33) had to take a lower-paying job after an accident left her unable to work at her previous one. I began making her meals like I did for my husband and myself as I knew she was struggling both financially and emotionally. She lives very close to us, so my husband always just dropped them off on his commute to work. I always added my extra touch to her meals as well, as I enjoy cooking and figured it would be a nice thing to do.

However she called me a few months ago and asked if I could stop making her lunches so bourgeois. I legitimately thought she was joking calling a heart-shaped piece of seaweed bourgeois, but according to her, none of her colleagues at work have such elaborate lunches, and it makes her feel as if she is flaunting her status.

She is not paying me for the lunches and it takes me an extra ten minutes maximum to add a fun touch to them, so I was confused on her train of thought. I thought that maybe her coworkers were taking her lunch and she didn’t want to tell me, but I agreed to make the lunches less fancy because I wanted her to feel comfortable.

Since I make the exact same meals for all three of us, now I just don’t put effort into the presentation of one of them. Since my husband drops off the lunch on his way to work, there has been one or two times where he has accidently given her the wrong box. I have labelled which lunch is not flourished, but in the rush of the commute there is still the occasional instance of taking the wrong box.

My sister-in-law asked me a few days ago if I could just stop making both me and my husband’s lunches “fancy”, due to the risk of her being given the wrong one. I refused, as it makes me happy to see the extra touch of personality in the food and told her that she wouldn’t die from one accidental “fancy” meal, which she was furious at and hung up on me.

She has been refusing to talk to me over the past few days and when I tried to call her to reason she kept hanging up. She has told my husband that she will only talk to me if I agree to stop making all of our lunches so “bourgeois”.

I am still making her lunches every day and my husband dropping them off, and while my husband agrees with me that her demand was out of order, he has now said that maybe I should just make all the food less flourished just so that she will not be angry if there is an accidental swap of lunches. I know it would be easy on me to just not flourish the food, but I don't want to give up my hobby for a theoretical chance of her recieving the wrong box. AITA for refusing?

Edit: This is out of character behavior for my SIL. She is usually a very sweet and considerate person, she watches my daughter for free, and has never been so reactionary about a lunch before. I'm unsure about completely stopping giving her lunches due to one issue when she is normally so kind.

Since my husband drops off the lunch on his way to work, there has been one or two times where he has accidently given her the wrong box. I have labelled which lunch is not flourished, but in the rush of the commute there is still the occasional instance of taking the wrong box.

My sister-in-law asked me a few days ago if I could just stop making both me and my husband’s lunches “fancy”, due to the risk of her being given the wrong one. I refused, as it makes me happy to see the extra touch of personality in the food and told her that she wouldn’t die from one accidental “fancy” meal, which she was furious at and hung up on me.

She has been refusing to talk to me over the past few days and when I tried to call her to reason she kept hanging up. She has told my husband that she will only talk to me if I agree to stop making all of our lunches so “bourgeois”.

I am still making her lunches every day and my husband dropping them off, and while my husband agrees with me that her demand was out of order, he has now said that maybe I should just make all the food less flourished just so that she will not be angry if there is an accidental swap of lunches. I know it would be easy on me to just not flourish the food, but I don't want to give up my hobby for a theoretical chance of her recieving the wrong box. AITA for refusing?

Edit: This is out of character behavior for my SIL. She is usually a very sweet and considerate person, she watches my daughter for free, and has never been so reactionary about a lunch before. I'm unsure about completely stopping giving her lunches due to one issue when she is normally so kind.

My husband and I (30ish) have a quite large family: his parents, his 2 siblings plus spouses and kids; my divorced parents and their new spouses, plus my siblings and their spouses and kids. 

All together we are well over 20 people so family gatherings can be overwhelming for the person hosting. (And yes, my divorced parents and their new spouses get along fine and there’s no drama.) 

Last night we celebrated Thanksgiving and as a family tradition everyone brings a dish. Usually we communicate with each other so that way everyone is making different types of food.

I thought it was very nice of her since her mon passed away this year and she was honoring her memory by making her recipe.

Although it did not smell weird it was very dry and just didn’t look like a regular one. I didn’t try it and discreetly told my husband my concerns, who also did not try it. 

Once Thanksgiving was over, my mother called me saying that my SIL was upset because she noticed I didn’t try her dish. I told my mother about my fears and she said that I’m just to picky with food and there’s no way a frozen casserole could last a year without having mold. I pointed that the several containers could mean she cut the “good parts” and left the moldy ones. After an awkward silence, we decided to agree to disagree and hang up. 

I feel bad for my SIL but I truly could not bring myself to eat something I am not 100% sure is safe. So AITA? 

Update to my post.

After spending my whole morning reading and answering your comments I decided to pass by my mother’s house and have an in person talk with her.  I read her some of the comments on the original post and she thinks the Internet is a strange place.  

We agreed I can always come and tell her what I think truthfully. She has not talked to anyone else in the family about the “Yam debacle.” We decided to call my brother and ask if we can go to his house qnd have a talk with him and my SIL .  He said to brace ourselves and come with an open mind.  When we got there, my SiL started crying uncontrollably and my brother took us to the kitchen which was a mess. 

Long story short. They were indeed leftovers just not a year old. I guess sometime before her passing, SIL and her mom had made several family recipes as a bonding experience. The casserole was one of the staple recipes and my SiL had froze several containers of it. On thanksgiving week, she thawed some of it and tried to replicate the taste without luck. I guess the pressure of making it for us got the best of her and she got more and more frustrated as the date approached. On Thursday,she finally gave up and decided to just reheat the ones she had frozen. 

As to why my SIL noticed that I didn’t eat her dish: Apparently in prior years I had complimented the casserole as “this is the best one I’ve ever tried.” So this year she was expecting some comment and was sad when I didn’t even try it. 

I apologized and told her I was really sorry that I hurt her feelings. She apologized for singling me out. We told her to rest and in the meantime  me, my mother and brother we cleaned the kitchen, tidy the house and Mom made her a soup (Ajiaco, if you know, you know.) 

My mom decided to stay but I left a bit after everything was done and everyone was calm. As a goodwill gesture I’m getting my SIL a mini spa day that I think she will enjoy and help her feel better.  So that’s pretty much it, no big fight, no big dramatic scene. Sorry not sorry. 

Thank you all for your opinions. I will be more thoughtful of peoples feelings but I still will not eat something I don’t want to just to please someone. No reports that anyone got sick, btw. 

Lastly, Does my mother think frozen food can get moldy? She claims she said it in the heat of the moment and because I was annoying her. She knows cooking is not my forte so she thought I had no good comeback to that. I opened her freezer and there’s only meat and ice cream.

And yeah, I say dad and daddy, and still say daddy as a 16 year old guy. Dad always referred to daddy as... daddy to me so I use it.

A month before I was born daddy died. My dad changed completely that day. Because of where we live, even back then, my daddy was still able to be recognized on my birth certificate. It was a fight and involved the courts. But it happened. It was really uncommon back then but he won the case thanks to Aunty Giga and other family members recognizing my two dads.

I grew up always knowing about daddy and I always cherished the connection to him. I was always glad my dad won the right for both of them to be legally my parents. I was also always treated like their son, not just dad's or not dad's and Aunty Giga's. 

When I was 4 my dad tried to date again and he met Sam. They dated for about 3 months but dad wasn't ready and Sam didn't like what he saw. He felt jealous and insecure that he wasn't being brought in as another dad for me.

They reconnected when I was 8 and got married when I was 12. My relationship with Sam is complicated and weird and he wants to adopt me. But I don't want him to be my dad, I don't want to be adopted by him or to have him take care of me if I become an orphan. He has always made it a point to bring up the fact daddy wasn't my bio father in the first place and how legally it was a miracle he's even on my birth certificate. I hate it. It feels so gross. He has told me at least I'll know him while daddy is someone who's just saintly in my mind because I wasn't allowed to process only having one parent. Even though I know I was raised by one parent. But I still had two. He just wasn't here. But I read the book he was putting together for me. He documented a lot of the parenting journey and surrogacy stuff and the pregnancy until his death. He was so excited. He loved me so much. He wanted me so badly.

On Father's Day we had a big fight over adoption. Dad was out and Sam brought up the adoption to me. He told me he's tired of feeling like an outsider because I always treat him like dad's spouse instead of my stepdad or my parent. I told him because that's what he is and he has to learn to accept that. I told him nothing changed for me. He told me it's stupid because I love one stepdad so much more. I told him daddy is more than just a stepdad and then I told him I don't want him to adopt me ever and bringing up daddy isn't winning me over. I told him if anything he's making me wish dad had found someone better. Dad doesn't know what happened but things have been tense since and Sam said I went too far.

The majority of members went with the less expensive tier for obvious reasons, and there's absolutely no *stigma* within our circle for doing so.  In fact only 9 out of our nearly forty members chose the more expensive tier, myself included.

Well I was picked to go 3rd and I selected a gift that was wrapped quite beautifully, thinking that was a good sign, but I was disappointed to discover the gift was a hot chocolate set that certainly wouldn't have met the criteria of the lower range, let alone the one we were participating in.  I could tell the others in the group felt roughly the same just by the looks on their face, and my focus was directed to one woman (Jen) who was looking away, clearly embarrassed.  As you might imagine, no one took my gift.

Now I know its petty not to be happy with what you're given, but let's be honest here in saying that Jen was throwing in the sort of thing you'd find on clearance at Walmart knowing full well she'd walk away with something pricey in turn.  In this case, Jen wound up with brand new Keurig.

I *discreetly* pulled our social group's leader aside and mentioned my concern to her.  She expressed she wasn't happy with this herself and that she'd even tried to tell Jen not to participate with the more expensive tier because it was well known that Jen wasn't doing great financially, but Jen had sworn up and down that it wouldn't be an issue.

We didn't want to disrupt events, so I was asked to put on a kind face and to avoid talking about the gift for the remainder of the evening, which I accepted as people were trying to have fun.

This morning I received a long winded text chain from Jen, expressing how frustrated she was that I'd demeaned her by complaining about her gift.  She went on and on about how nice it must be that I can simply throw my money away while others, like her, are struggling, and that her income shouldn't mean she can't have nice things.  Instead of fighting, I forwarded the texts to our group leader, and I've since received word that Jen would no longer be a member of our social group.

Now, if I'm being honest, I do genuinely feel bad because I know how happy being a member of this group made Jen.  She has had a lot of setbacks in her life.  I do not hate her or hold any negative feelings for her at all.  I simply felt she was knowingly taking advantage of the rest of us to basically trade up beyond her means.

Edit: So some additional details have emerged in the days since my post.  Apparently, our club's leader had never even had the opportunity to speak with Jen following my conversation with her.  Instead, Jen was riled up by other group members messaging her following the party, accusing her of taking advantage of the situation.  So when Jen messaged me in the morning, it was on the assumption that I had been going around talking poorly about her, when in reality I'd only expressed my concerns to the club's leadership.

When our club's leader (btw, I say leader because AITA's bot does not like you saying pr3zident) called her following me forwarding the text chain, Jen was amped up for a fight and was hostile from the very second she answered the call.  After a lot great deal of insults and cursing from Jen, our leader then decided that she should no longer be welcome in our group going forward.

Allie has never followed this and will always call them repeatedly for the most mundane stuff. If one doesn't answer she'll sometimes call my other parent. 

All that to say a couple of weeks ago she broke her leg while working around the house. I was in a workshop for work that day and could only check my phone on breaks. She called my parents since they live a couple streets over but neither answered their phones. She wound up having to call an ambulance. I got her message about 2 hours after she fell and went to the hospital. She was pretty mad at my parents when I got there. I let then know what happened and they also rushed to the hospital to apologize and check on her.

She got mad I wanted to invite them and is of the mind I shouldn't be wanting to see/speak with them after they ignored her.

AITA for not wanting to use my inheritance to pay for building my husband’s sisters a home on our farm?
My husband (52) and myself (50) have been married for 31 years. We purchased his parents farm several years ago and paid for it with a mortgage. We have since paid that mortgage off. We also built our forever home on the farm and it is also paid for and we raise cattle on the farm. 
His family is always asking for help. His sisters specifically and a couple of his nephews. For context, we took care of his father, mother, and Down’s syndrome sister when nobody else in his family would take care of them. We were the only ones of his siblings who still had young children at home but we felt that if we didn’t take care of them the state was going to step in and take them away. In my family you take care of your family so we took them in and never looked back. 
However I think his family resented us for this and somehow feels like they are owed something because we own the family farm. And for some reason my husband thinks he has to take care of his other sisters even though there is nothing wrong with them except they have low IQs. 

I have inherited a decent amount of money from my parents. My husband doesn’t know the specifics and is upset that I won’t disclose the amount. He doesn’t have access to the account. He wants me to take some of the money and build a house on our farm (his family farm) for his sisters to live in so they won’t have to pay rent anymore or live in apartments. He wants us to pay their property taxes and insurance because “they won’t be able to afford that” but they can pay their utilities. He doesn’t want to charge them rent. 

Why should I use my inheritance that my parents worked their butts off to earn and pass on to me so that my husband’s lazy sisters can sit in a brand new house on their family’s farm and never have to pay property tax or insurance or rent? I feel like this is my money and I shouldn’t have to spend it on his family. 

I want to put the majority of it in trust funds to our two children so I can pass it on to them. 
And to be honest I am seriously thinking about just taking my inheritance and getting a divorce and living happily ever after.

I apologise. 

My son is eleven months old and 97th percentile for height. He is a big ass baby (currently 36in tall - or about the size of your average 2.5yo) and in 3T clothing. 

However, despite him being so big, he is still just a baby and most of his nutrition ia still from breastmilk. 

For the 4th we had a big family cookout and my brother invited his girlfriend. I live out of state and I didn't want my flights to be too close together so I'm staying for a bit longer. My brother and his girlfriend are doing the same thing.

My family is aware that my son is a baby, obviously, but my brothers girlfriend was not and was initially very shocked when she saw him ""misbehaving"". We explained that he's still a baby, so he's still just exploring the world.

She remained uncomfortable but we mostly avoid each other. Because he's so big feeding him is a chore so I use an armchair as there isn't enough support elsewhere and so there isn't much I can do about covering up (he gets sweaty under blankets and won't eat).

It's been a tense couple of weeks. Last night I think we both kind of lost it. My son needed feeding and she was in the chair; I asked her to move which she whined about but did get up. Everything was fine for another hour or so until she demanded my brother pay for her to go to a hotel for the remaining nights because she can't cope with me and the baby.

He asked what she meant and she said that he's clearly big enough to be on real food and I enjoy making her uncomfortable by feeding him in front of her. 

I got embarrassingly upset and told her that she should keep her mouth shut because she clearly doesn't know the first thing about parenting and certainly doesn't know anything about me or my son.

We argued the same points for a little more until my son woke from his nap and I left to collect him. She then left after telling us all, loudly, that she needs to ""protect her peace"" (which is honestly not a phrase I thought real people said). 

My brother told me I was being immature and left with her. My dad is on ""my side"" but did tell me I should have removed myself from the situation as I'm a grown woman and she's still a teenager (I'm three years older than her so I think thats BS). My mom is neutral but is still trying to convince my brother to come home and ended up paying for their hotel. She thinks I could have been a lot more understanding.

As someone who grew up with siblings, it's very clear that oldest daughter (ON) is golden child. She gets whatever she wants, no matter how expensive, and is always showered with praise for her pageants and singing. My younger niece (YN) is very shy, but she is still very sweet and enjoys things like reading and animals. Recently, my YN has been feeling bad about herself. I asked why, and she told me it was because she didn't like her hair color. She's got auburn curls. She was sad because everyone always said how pretty ON's hair was, which was a very light blonde and straight. It got so bad that she'd apparently tried to cut it off, which her mom had just laughed off as childhood mishap. 

When I was over at brother's house, I noticed that the two were playing with dolls. ON had a very nice Barbie doll, while YN had what looked like a short, cheap Walmart knockoff. I asked why, and mom said it was because she couldn't find a doll with red hair. This made me upset, because 1. The doll's hair is bright red, which is not her hair color, and 2. It was extremely different quality. I said nothing, but when it was YN birthday, I acted. For months I researched doll making and restoring. I took a Barbie, and replaced her hair with some that matched hers and painted the eyes. I then hand sewed several custom outfits, and gave each a blue whale theme (her favorite animal). As a cosplayer, this wasn't that hard. 

On her birthday, YN was ecstatic. But her sister was obviously not. I didn't pay attention to her, instead focusing on making sure YN liked her gifts. But only a few days later, her parents called me, telling me that I needed to make ON a doll as well. I said I'd get her one on her next birthday. They said no, she needed it immediately because she'd been upset that her sister's doll was customized unlike her store bought ones, and was mad that YN wouldn't share. I told them again that it was a project, and I'd make her one next year. They both accused me of not caring about ON's feelings. I got mad, saying that neither of them cared about being fair when YN was playing with a troll doll that was supposed to 'look like her'.

My girlfriend always complains about her weight and her body. I tell her I find her sexy for so many reasons outside her body and it didn’t matter to me whether she got bigger or smaller.

Eventually she decided she wanted to lose weight, I offered to help and when I pointed out things she could be doing better she gets mad at me. She isn’t losing weight currently and in fact says she is gaining a few extra pounds.

I ask her what exactly she eats in a day, she says she eats healthy so she should lose weight. I question that and we have an argument. I tell her that if she wants to show me, let me just spend a day with her and see what she eats in a day. She said only if I don’t make comments on what she’s eating as she’s eating it. I agreed.

Now by the end of the day she had consumed, a plate of avocado toast that was about 400 calories, a coffee that was 110 calories, an 800 calorie salad from chick fil a and a fry (as a “reward” for the salad) and veggie burrito that was about 500 calories. Along with snakinga but throughout the day. Her total consumption was about 2200 calories.

At the end of the day I explained this to her. My exact words were that the amount of calories she is consuming is the amount I need to maintain my weight as a man 5 inches and 20 pounds bigger, who is constantly active. So chances are she’ll slowly gain weight eating like that and that eating healthy isn’t going to guarantee she’ll lose weight.

She got super fucking pissed at me and told me I wasn’t helping her and was just shaming her. I told her I want to help her but she did not listen.

Last week, my sister law gave birthday to a healthy baby girl, as you can probably guess, they named Scarlett. I was really upset at my brother as he knows that was my top name, I didn’t make a big deal about it I just left the room obviously upset, Scarlett isn’t a family name or anything and my brother has never mentioned liking the name, one time he said he wasn’t a fan. I asked him why he would name his daughter that and he told me to stop over reacting and get over it and that i don’t own the name. I get that It doesn’t belong to me but just because I am a teenager doesn’t mean
that I am not allowed to have plans for my future.

EDIT: when i say walked out I didnt like storm out or anything i just excused myself. A lot of people are saying that its common for cousins to have to same name but not here and in my family. And. Scarlett isnt a common name here ❤️❤️

I need your opinion on grocery store etiquette and not letting someone cut the line. Tonight after work I stopped by my local grocery store to grab a handful of items to make dinner. 5 items in total. I maneuvered my cart behind an older woman who was slowly navigating putting her groceries on the belt to be checked out. She was the only person I noticed in front of me.

A few minutes later another woman tries to edge her way in line in front of my cart. I gave her a quizzical look and she said ""Oh, I was here before, but I went to go and see if the other line over there was moving faster.""

I said, ""Okay, but you weren't here when I arrived soooo (shrug).""

The woman proceeded to inform me, she was here first and that she should be let back in because she only stepped away to see if the other line was faster. I replied that I did not see her here before I joined the line, so, she could get behind me or go back to the other line.

At this point she showed me that she only had a few things and was shocked that I wasn't going to let her back in (she had 4 packs of jello). I pointed out that I too only had a few things and I wasn't going to move because I did not see her in the line in front of me when I joined.

Now this is where I may be the Asshole. At this point we're both getting frustrated in this grocery store pissing match for pole position. She says ""So you're not going to let me back in? Where's your Christmas spirit?"". I'd had enough of her entitlement at this point and I shot back ""Don't pull that shit.""

Honestly, if I had been behind her in line, I would have happily held her place if she has asked. But she wasn't there when I arrived and she just assumed she could cut back in line after a few minutes. Using Christmas Spirit as a means to get what she wanted was the last straw for me.

In the end she, glared at me and said ""I hope you have a Merry Christmas"" her voice dripping with sarcasm. And she left to go back over to another cashier.

The irony is, we both left the store with our items at the same time.

Felix and I sat down and had a conversation about how to manage his mother going forwards. I told him everything that she had said to me and he was adequately furious with her. He asked me exactly what I wanted done in the future so that she'd understand where our boundaries are. And follow them. I told him that I'd rather him speak to her alone at first so that I wasn't immediately made out to be the bad guy.

I acted on advice and locksmith has been called to change the locks on the house, and Felix has ordered us a Ring doorbell off Amazon with the assurance 'I'll be able to put it in' (he hates doing the electrics but you know how it is I'll leave him to it lol). And then he called up MIL and organised a lunch date for today so they could have a talk between themselves. He got back in the afternoon and as he walked into the door, smiled at me and went ""Sorted!"" and, characteristically, went to go and make himself a cup of tea.

I got a message a few minutes later from her saying she was very sorry for what she had said to me, that she was in the wrong.

And after added that she was sorry for the comments she'd made on my appearance. I'll believe it when I see it but at least it's a good start, and we've all agreed to go for dinner at some point to talk about future expectations when the the baby comes.

I talked to Felix, and he said that she'd been offended at first, didn't believe she'd done anything wrong, and he also specifically said she hit with the spiel of ""Oh I must be such an awful mother then"", and he told me he'd told her ""It's not about that, it's about you disrespecting my wife, our child and our home. If you continue, you're not going to dream of being able to see your grandchild."". She was apparently and unsurprisingly sulky, and he told her to apologise, and she said she would and to her credit did.

Thank you all for your advice about how to handle thing going forwards with the locks and everything. The amount of support was crazy but I can't thank you all enough, I feel so much calmer about the situation. I don't know if she's going to stick to what she said going forwards, but at least boundaries have been set and I know that Felix has my back.

My husband and I are doing okay financially, we make enough to not worry about rent and necessities, we are saving a decent amount and have scope for growth in our careers. I make a little more than 1/3 of our combined income. We are both in our late 30s and we have two 6 yr old boys. I have never liked my husband's family (most of them anyways) because they have a lot of old fashioned opinions and don't really approve of me. We don't have a lot of contact so it's okay though. 

  
My husband's cousin's wedding is this week and they are getting married in our city, so he offered for his parents and aunt and uncle to stay with us. (bride and groom are renting a place.) It is a bit of squeeze but it is working. They have been here for two days now and on the first day I heard them having a whole discussion on how it's so sad that out children won't get to have a ""proper"" childhood with a mom at home, like my husband and his cousin got.

**Edit:** 

Thank you to everyone who commented, reading through the comments made me cry and I do intend to respond to them I just feel a bit overwhelmed by all of the kindness. I am a longtime lurker of Reddit so this is all very new to me.

I want to thank those who corrected me, late husband is the term I was trying to think of but couldn’t when I wrote this, I find it really hard to word everything about my late husband like the term ‘moved on’ feels very casual and inaccurate but I am not sure what is an accurate way to say it. 

But I am keeping my necklace.

 

I just wanted to clear up that my best friend is really one of the most incredible people, she is my rock, and a big part of why I am still around and not locked away somewhere (hospital, prison it felt like it could have gone either way for a while there). She and my mum tag-teamed me after the accident and made sure I ate and would just sit with me in silence. She found a grief support group and would drive me there and wait for me in the carpark when meetings finished.

And what I could never repay her for was how she stood so strongly for me during the court hearings, I had never felt such pure, unadulterated hatred towards anyone or anything as I did to that driver and she held my hand through it all and helped me get through it. She let me sit in my grief and anger but didn’t let it consume me.

It felt like my brain snapped and she helped me stick it back together, but like that Japanese art style where they repair broken vases with gold so it is broken but when it is put back together it is stronger and more beautiful. I don’t know where I would be without her because she didn’t have to do any of what and she did.

I don’t like the way she worded what she said, but she has always been the type that after a breakup she tosses away any reminders of her ex, I’ve gone with her to buy new clothing to replace ones that hold to vivid of memories. I think what some of the comments say is right and that she compares the grief she has experienced from breakups to what I have experienced. Which while you can’t compare grief because grief is grief, the experiences are worlds apart.  

 

Ava really isn’t a bad person, she was my sister for years, I used to absolutely adore her (after I turned 19 though, before 19 she thought me and her brother were brats). But after the court hearings my former MIL, FIL and to an extent Ava cut contact with me because seeing me brought back to many memories, which I understand but it hurt me deeply because they were a big part of my family since I was 15.

Ava and I still kept in contact but it was more of a holidays and birthdays kind of thing with the occasional drinks and dinner. So, while I still have a lot of love for her our relationship has changed drastically, and her asking me what she did and how she worded it was really not in the realm of anything I thought she would say or ask of me. She does have some of my late husband’s belongings like things from his childhood and knickknacks and some clothing so I don’t understand why she would think to ask for my necklace.

I am going to take advice from the comments and talk to her and try to figure out where she is coming from, reading the different perspectives has really helped me think more clearly and feel a little less hurt by what she said. Because of our history I want to give her the benefit of the doubt at first, but if she pushes the topic then I will have to make some choices. I am not sure how I am going to word it yet or if I want to say it via text or in person. But I will figure that out.



Grief is really strange and hard and isn’t something you understand until it happens to you.

What kind of helped me to understand, and made me feel like I wasn’t losing my mind, was the visualisation that your soul is like a bubble that grows with you and your experiences and relationships and you are just floating around in it. Good experiences and relationships add things to the bubble that make it beautiful like little bits of glitter and flowers and fluffiness. Bad things add spikes and staples and grief is like one big spike that when it first strikes goes from one end to the other and encompasses everything and you bump up against it all the time at first and it just really hurts. Then time passes and your bubble grows around the spike, the spike is still there but you don’t touch it as often, but when you do it hurts just as bad as the first time. But the upside to that is the good things like joy like when you think of someone you love and it’s all fluffy and safe and nice. I don’t know if that makes sense to anyone else but it has always helped me to remember that fresh, fiery pain won’t feel like that forever and that I will bump up against something fluffy and kind and happy.

You can even fall in love again, which I am so lucky and grateful for my fiancé. He is truly a gem (to soon?) of a man and makes me feel so safe and warm. Which is a feeling that I didn’t feel for a long, long while.

But just always make sure the people you love know that you love them, give them extra hugs, go and see or call that person you have been meaning to (this only goes for the people who deserve to be in your life). Always leave things on a pleasant note, even if you are arguing you don’t even have to make up just make sure your parting words are pleasant and loving. Because you really never know when something could happen, you always think you have time.

My goal in life is to have my relationships with people in such a way that my final words won’t have to be tell \*blank\* I love them, because they will already know.","AITA for not giving my former SIL the necklace I had made from my wedding rings from my deceased husband?When I (27F) was 22 I got married to my high school sweetheart who passed away five months after we married when a drunk driver drove into his car.

Al is a total slob. He leaves dirty dishes, empty bottles, etc everywhere and expects Lia to clean up. He has split custody of two young kids from his ex, who he just lets run free, expecting Lia to do the work even though they’re HIS kids. On top of that, he’s told Lia to get him a beer while she’s busy and he’s watching TV a few times in front of Ky and me, so I can’t imagine how he treats her when we’re not around. Their house is always a mess because Lia works 60 hours a week and doesn’t have the time to take care of two small kids and Al, clean, and work long hours. Yet somehow, I think Lia really loves Al. She looks at him like he is the only man in the world. When she talks about him, her eyes light up and her voice is sweet and melodic.

That’s why when Lia asked if she and Al could use the vacation home this week, I said yes. I figured what’s the worst that could happen. Plus, Ky and I already planned on going three days after them, so we’d overlap.

When Ky and I got there, the vacation house was a pig sty. It smelled like rotting food. There was a mountain of dirty dishes in the sink, the floor was sticky and there were drawings on the walls with crayons. We got to the living room, where lo and behold Lia was scrambling to pick up toys and Al was drinking a beer in a rocking chair. I immediately snatched the beer from his hand and asked him why he wasn’t cleaning the mess he made. He asked why I assumed it was him and not Lia? I said it’s because I’m not an idiot. He just chuckled and said Lia was doing the cleaning and there didn’t need to be two people cleaning. His nonchalance really ticked me off, so I told him he and his sticky kids had an hour to pack up their things and leave before I called the cops. Al looked at Ky and Ky was like, “What are you looking at ME for? Go pack!”

At this point, Lia was really upset with me. She said they were looking forward to unwinding and I walked in and ruined it in 5 minutes, not even considering other resolutions to conflict. Plus I had no claim to the house since I didn’t buy it myself. I told her there is no conflict–Al is deadweight and that’s that. And as for the house, Ky “owns” it and he was with me. She said if Al was leaving, she was leaving too. That night, I got a call from my mom asking why I kicked Lia out. I told her I kicked AL out and Lia followed. My mom told me I need to be more accepting of new members of the family and that not everyone has the same living style as me. Now she’s mad, and Lia won’t talk to me. Was I TA in this situation?","AITA for kicking my sister's boyfriend out of my vacation home?My husband “Ky” and I own a vacation home on Lake Michigan. We both own it technically, but it was his before we got married (this becomes relevant later). My sister “Lia” has been using our vacation home since Ky and I started dating. We don’t mind, She is always clean and courteous, and leaves it better than she found it. However, she started dating her bf “Al” about a year ago, and I can’t say the same for him.

Al is a total slob. He leaves dirty dishes, empty bottles, etc everywhere and expects Lia to clean up. He has split custody of two young kids from his ex, who he just lets run free, expecting Lia to do the work even though they’re HIS kids. On top of that, he’s told Lia to get him a beer while she’s busy and he’s watching TV a few times in front of Ky and me, so I can’t imagine how he treats her when we’re not around.

Neither of us like the spotlight so agreed on a small event. The only thing I was firm about was I didn’t want photos. 

My self esteem is in the toilet. In the last 18months I have put on weight. 
I am not looking to make excuses but there are some reasons why.

  1. In the last 18moths I have lost both parents and my grandmother. I have lost 2 jobs and had a miscarriage. Depression has hit me hard at times and I have been comfort eating.

2. I was put on a new medication and weight gain is a side effect.

3. About a year ago I broke my left ankle badly. I have had 3 surgeries to date (the last one was 10days before the wedding). I can’t walk without pain

I really didn’t want photos that would remind me of the fact I am now fat.

Few weeks before the wedding my mother in law is talking about going to a local beauty spot for photos. I say no thank you and that yes I am being serious. My husband hears this and later that night I say again I really don’t want photos and he says that is fine with him.

Week before the wedding I am having the same conversation with MIL and my husband. 

Day of the wedding my FIL and MIL pick us up. I am no longer able to drive as I can’t move my ankle.

We get the whole legal shindig done and as we are going back to the car MIL again says let’s go to the beauty spot for photos. I again so no but she tells FIL to drive there and my husband just sits there.I know I gave him “the look” but total silence.

Long story short the photos are taken and we head back. 

In the car driving home my MIL starts showing me the photos and I hate myself in them. I look like a pile of fat shit. I look ridiculous in a dress with a medical boot and I can’t stop the tears rolling down my cheeks.

This upsets my mother in law and there is an atmosphere the whole rest of the day. I really tried to move on, but I had to get out of that stupid dress and all I really just wanted to hide away.

Privately I told my husband him and his mother ruined our wedding day for me because all I can think of is those pictures. He said he didn’t realise I was so serious about no photos, that it’s only for his mum to keep and that he thinks I look beautiful. 

I told him that not 30mins into our marriage he totally let me down and I don’t know if I am beyond hurt or furious.  

He said I was being ridiculous and that I let him down by making such a fuss over a “normal part of weddings”. He also said I had hurt his mother (she has some mental health issues and has been obsessing over me crying on my wedding day) and that I need to reassure her she hasn’t done anything wrong.

I told him no and there will be serious problems if he tries telling her otherwise because as far as I am concerned they both totally ignored my one request and that was unacceptable.

He thinks I am being a totally unreasonable AH.

So am I being an AH reddit?


UPDATE - 

With all the comments saying I disregarded my husband’s wishes on his wedding day I asked him directly “did you want those photos and just said you didn’t appease me?” 

Before you all pile on (again) there is no reason he would not answer truthfully.

He replied that he did not care about the photos MIL took in the woods. He said having seen them they are objectively bad (he clarified poorly taken on a shitty phone) not something he would want to keep and not worth the distress caused.

He said the only photo he would want was one of the look on my face staring up at him when we said the “I dos”. He joked that he should have strapped a go-pro to his forehead to capture that but he doesn’t NEED a photo to remember it.

I would not have been against that idea because it would have been private between just us.

He cannot give a reason for being silent in the car. MIL has a server mental disorder and I believe there is fear around setting her off on a spiral. 

I explained how ambushed I felt and that I only got out of the car to try and keep the peace. That really upset him. He apologised for not speaking up. I think he understands the main issues were not being supported and feeling helpless. 

Everybody saying I should have not got out - I am sure you would call me the AH for throwing a childish tantrum refusing to leave the car if I post that scenario. I was in a lose lose situation. 

I apologised for letting my insecurities become part of our marriage. He hadn’t realised just how deep my issues run. I am guilty of putting on a brave face so I can’t blame him for that.

We don’t want any drama. I am not going to hold a grudge against MIL. This is the first time there has ever been an issue like this in our family. Husband will talk to her but not about my insecurities. He suggested asking her to delete the photos but I said we both know he would have to die on that hill. We are going to move past the whole thing. However, I don’t know what to do if she makes them public.

We both agree that what matters is our 9 year long relationship that is now a marriage and not a single day where some papers were signed. I am sure that comment is going to upset a lot of people who feel a wedding day should be a magical life changing event but it is how WE view OUR lives together, nothing to do with your feelings.

I wouldn’t put our relationship/marriage on hold because times are tough so why would I put this one day off?

We are not American and marriage is not such a big deal here. Many couples never marry and that is very normal. Since before everything happened our main reason for getting married was so I could legally use his protected surname.

This is why we just went to the registry office and it was 8 people in attendance.

I apologise for my fatphobic language. Growing up in the 90’s with a mother with an ED has clearly had an effect on how I view bodies and I need to work on that. 

I have had counselling for feelings around my loss of mobility which has naturally touched on the other issues in my life but I am going to speak to my doctor about more specialised grief counselling going forward.

I got a call this morning from Grace asking if I could come over and spend the morning with her. I told her that unfortunately I had a few things I had to do before I could leave for my concert. She got very quiet and asked me if I was still going to that. I told her yes, I leave in 5 hours for the airport. 

She said that she couldn’t believe I could still think about a concert when she has just become an orphan with no one in the world but our family (which is true). 

I told her that I am so sorry, and that when I get back I will take off a few days to be with her if she needs. But that this is something I have been looking forward to and also my friends coming with me are counting on me for things like the hotel, rental car, etc.

She got angry and told me that I was a horrible sister in law and that she hopes when my mom dies, everyone abandons me, too.

I particularly don’t like the way she behaves towards my own daughter Bella (she is six.) Quinn crosses the line. A particular episode of verbal cruelty at a birthday party was when I’d had enough and told Quinn “I don’t want you to come over until you can start being nice to Bella.” Teresa was present when I said this.



We live a short walk away from each other. A few days ago, Quinn arrived and wanted dinner, and I turned her away at the door and told her “I don’t like how you treat my daughter. Unless it is an emergency, you are not welcome over.”



Teresa called me because she said I was a horrible person for turning Quinn away because she is sixteen and my niece was upset.



(Teresa has stopped trying to do anything serious about Quinn’s verbal attitude and has justified it in the past with statements along the lines of “That’s just how some teenagers are,” “It’s a teen thing.

Teresa and I have both given our sides to mutual friends and acquaintances, and they are divided. Some are saying that Quinn’s attitude is not okay, but I was wrong to turn her away at the door because she’s still sixteen and my niece.



They said being a teenager and rapidly going from childhood to adulthood is already a rough transition. And according to Teresa, Quinn appears to be having issues at school, and I should try to have more patience with her and see what may be going on outside of home.



Regardless of the reason, I feel I had to set a hard boundary with Quinn’s behavior. It isn’t an easy time, but at sixteen, you still know right from wrong.

To be honest, they never fully accepted my marriage to Lily in the first place.

Since Lily passed, my sister Emma (28F), who’s always been the golden child, has been eyeing the necklace. She’s getting married soon and recently mentioned how, now that I’m “not really married anymore,” I should pass it on to her.

That was hard to hear, but what really broke me happened last week at a family dinner. We were talking about her wedding, and she made a joke about setting me up with one of her fiancé Luke’s (35M) friends. I felt uncomfortable, but tried to brush it off. Then she said, “At least Lily won’t be there to haunt you if you hook up with someone!”

I told her there was no way I could come to the wedding if that’s how she feels about Lily and my grief. Things escalated from there. Emma accused me of being “dramatic” and said I was ruining her big day over “one little joke.” My parents took her side, saying I should just let it go and show up to support my sister. They even mentioned again how I should give Emma the family necklace, saying that since I’m “not using it anymore,” it should go to her now.

Since then, I’ve been bombarded with calls from my parents, Emma, and even Luke. They’ve all told me I’m selfish, that I need to “move on” and stop holding onto the past. Luke even said I should be grateful my family didn’t disown me when I came out, as if I owe them something for barely tolerating me.

Now, I’m questioning everything. Am I being unreasonable for not wanting to go to her wedding after all this? Part of me wonders if I should just suck it up and go, but another part of me can’t believe how little my family seems to care about Lily, or me, for that matter.

Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/ph0ln6I44a

Original BLUF: I told my fiancé his best friend can’t come to our wedding. She pretends I don’t exist & he does nothing to address it. 

The comments on my original post opened my eyes and made me realize that despite this being the healthiest relationship I’ve been in, it doesn’t mean it’s actually healthy. We’ve had a couple conversations surrounding this issue, which mostly consisted of me saying it bothered me & him saying he I was the only one who cared. 

A couple things helped me realize my breaking point-

1. I asked him if he would be okay with our daughters future partner treating them like this, to which he got flustered, shut down, and said he didn’t want to talk about it. (I left it alone) 

2. He said he didn’t want to end his friendship or do anything to jeopardize it because “what if we break up.” This made me realize he would not protect me as his wife, since he didn’t as his girlfriend. 

The final straw was when I expressed how much it bothered me that he wanted me to blow this off since we, as in me & the best friend, only see each other 4-6 times a year & he said (directly quoted because this is burned into my brain) : “I know the way she treats you is garbage, but you’re allowing one person to dictate our relationship.” 

“It could be worse. She could be more active. There are worse ways to meddle, people text and lie, and all that to break relationships up.”

The first line broke my heart and told me all I needed to know. I have to truck through a couple more months of pre-planned & paid for  social engagements, but I closed the curtain on any chance of healing this relationship the moment those words left his mouth. 

Thank you everyone for the advice, common sense, knocking me upside my head, and similar related experiences & outcomes. 

I’m gonna go to therapy & redefine what a healthy, balanced, and communicative relationship. 

EDIT: the preplanned events aren’t the wedding/ engagement related. We share a home, need to divide assets, pets, a custody schedule. Additionally we have vacations, planned with a mutually shared friend group (bf not part of that group). I appreciate the concerns but I need to plan things out a little more. There will be no second chance. 

To those that keep saying they’re fucking- probably . When I first brought this up, he became stressed & kept emphasizing how I thought he was fuckin his best friend, and didn’t address the issue that was brought up. I don’t care to know or confirm. 

EDIT 2: We are NOT getting married, continuing our relationship. For those thinking I’m using the preplanned events to justify holding out good- absolutely f*ckin not. Our relationship was dead the moment he admitted she treated my like garbage, and basically shrugged it off. 

As a note- I NEVER asked him to cut anyone off, out of his life. I simply asked for basic greetings & acknowledgment during the rare encounters with his BFF.  This hasn’t happened, aside from a couple of begrudging times 

FINAL EDIT: I tried asking him the “what would you tell your daughter to do” question. He answered that if she loved her partner, she shouldn’t care about outside ppl. Additionally he  said he was tired of talking about it, he feels he’s done all he can, and he doesn’t want us(me) to bring her up because he’s tired of talking about it.

","UPDATE: AITA for not allowing my fiancés BF come to our wedding? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/ph0ln6I44a

Original BLUF: I told my fiancé his best friend can’t come to our wedding. She pretends I don’t exist & he does nothing to address it. 

The comments on my original post opened my eyes and made me realize that despite this being the healthiest relationship I’ve been in, it doesn’t mean it’s actually healthy. We’ve had a couple conversations surrounding this issue, which mostly consisted of me saying it bothered me & him saying he I was the only one who cared. 

A couple things helped me realize my breaking point-

1. I asked him if he would be okay with our daughters future partner treating them like this, to which he got flustered, shut down, and said he didn’t want to talk about it. (I left it alone) 

2. He said he didn’t want to end his friendship or do anything to jeopardize it because “what if we break up.” This made me realize he would not protect me as his wife, since he didn’t as his girlfriend. 

The final straw was when I expressed how much it bothered me that he wanted me to blow this off since we, as in me & the best friend, only see each other 4-6 times a year & he said (directly quoted because this is burned into my brain) : “I know the way she treats you is garbage, but you’re allowing one person to dictate our relationship.” 

“It could be worse. She could be more active. There are worse ways to meddle, people text and lie, and all that to break relationships up.”

The first line broke my heart and told me all I needed to know. I have to truck through a couple more months of pre-planned & paid for  social engagements, but I closed the curtain on any chance of healing this relationship the moment those words left his mouth. 

Thank you everyone for the advice, common sense, knocking me upside my head, and similar related experiences & outcomes. 

I’m gonna go to therapy & redefine what a healthy, balanced, and communicative relationship. 

EDIT: the preplanned events aren’t the wedding/ engagement related. We share a home, need to divide assets, pets, a custody schedule. Additionally we have vacations, planned with a mutually shared friend group (bf not part of that group). I appreciate the concerns but I need to plan things out a little more. There will be no second chance. 

To those that keep saying they’re fucking- probably . When I first brought this up, he became stressed & kept emphasizing how I thought he was fuckin his best friend, and didn’t address the issue that was brought up. I don’t care to know or confirm. 

EDIT 2: We are NOT getting married, continuing our relationship. For those thinking I’m using the preplanned events to justify holding out good- absolutely f*ckin not. Our relationship was dead the moment he admitted she treated my like garbage, and basically shrugged it off. 

As a note- I NEVER asked him to cut anyone off, out of his life. I simply asked for basic greetings & acknowledgment during the rare encounters with his BFF.  This hasn’t happened, aside from a couple of begrudging times 

FINAL EDIT: I tried asking him the “what would you tell your daughter to do” question. He answered that if she loved her partner, she shouldn’t care about outside ppl. Additionally he  said he was tired of talking about it, he feels he’s done all he can, and he doesn’t want us(me) to bring her up because he’s tired of talking about it.  I told him our relationship is done I  September (when our lease is up etc), apologized for bringing it up, and asked if he wanted to be alone for the evening.

Thank you everyone for helping me realize I wasn’t asking for to much. I really thought he was the one for me, but I wasn’t thinking straight. I’m tired & I want better for myself. I’m ok with being alone. 

I appreciate you all. Have a good night

He didn't stop and she hold true to her word. The rest of the day all of the kids were mad at him.

I picked them both up and she informed me above what happened. Mom told me he behaved the rest of the day after that. Jamie was very upset about no one liking him, the kids basically ignored him. Even my youngest was pissed off at him.


My mother told me that he needs to learn his actions affect other people and I agree with her. I am 100 percent fine with her using social dynamics to get him to behave. It also seemed to work, she plans to take the kids to pool on Friday.

Hi everyone. I’m a 19-year-old mom to my beautiful 2-year-old daughter, Amelia. Just a bit of backstory: last year, I was asked to be a bridesmaid in a family friend’s wedding. I was thrilled and immediately said yes, even though it was a child-free event. I had arranged for a babysitter, but about a week before the wedding, she informed me that she would no longer be in the city and couldn’t watch my daughter.

Given the short notice, I approached the bride and asked if I could bring Amelia to the wedding, as I didn’t have time to find another trusted babysitter. My daughter is overall a very easygoing baby—she’s comfortable with people and happy as long as she’s fed. The bride knew this since she’d watched my daughter on multiple occasions before, and she happily agreed, saying that having Amelia there would make the wedding photos even more special.

The wedding was going smoothly, though I noticed a few stares from the groom’s parents. Amelia stayed with my sisters for most of the day, but during the reception, I took her with me to congratulate the couple. As I approached with Amelia in my arms, the groom’s mother suddenly commented, “You shouldn’t have brought a baby to a child-free wedding, especially when she doesn’t fit the family.”

I was completely taken aback. For context, my daughter is mixed—I’m half white and half Hispanic, and her father is Black. I’ve been called “white-washed” because I’m not in contact with my Hispanic family, so I knew exactly what she meant by saying my daughter didn’t “fit the family.”

The bride looked shocked, and the groom immediately stood up and led his parents away. Taking this as my cue, I decided it was time to leave. I made the rounds to say goodbye to everyone and put Amelia in her stroller. As I was leaving, the bride came over to apologize for her in-laws’ behavior. I was upset, but I knew it wasn’t her fault, so I simply wished her luck and left.

Now, about a week after the wedding, I got tagged in a Facebook post—strange, because I don’t use Facebook. The post read: “I’m outraged that my grandchildren weren’t allowed at this event, but when a teen mother who couldn’t be responsible enough to leave her child with the father brings her baby, it’s perfectly fine.” The post was from the groom’s mother. To make things worse, she’s also been telling family members that I’m lying about what she said regarding my daughter’s appearance.

So now I’m wondering, am I the asshole?

Update: 

Hi again, everyone. I first want to start off with a huge thank you for all the advice and reassurance! That said, before I go into this post I’ve seen a few racist comments towards my daughter and remarks about my age and how I ruined my life. I am extremely happy and so is my daughter, she is beautiful and it is terrible that people in this world will take their self hate out on a two year old. Anyways, I wanted to give an update and clarify a few things after read on the feedback I received. First off, I do have a Facebook account, but I don’t use it often. I only found out about the post because someone sent it to me on messages, which is how I saw the groom’s mother’s comments.

Regarding Amelia’s father, he couldn’t take her that weekend because he lives a bit farther away and struggles when plans change last minute, especially when it’s not his scheduled days to have her. On top of that, my family members who I would trust to watch Amelia were all attending the wedding, so there weren’t many other options.

Now, some of you mentioned I could have dropped out of the wedding, and I want to address that. Dropping out of the bridal party was actually the first option I presented to the bride when I realized I couldn’t find a new babysitter. I didn’t want to complicate her big day. However, she didn’t want me to drop out and reassured me that it would be fine to bring Amelia. So while bringing my daughter was the second option, the bride did have the choice of me stepping down if she had preferred that.

Yesterday, I spoke with the bride again, and she told me that she explained everything to her MIL, making it clear that it wasn’t my fault Amelia was there—it was a decision made between her and her husband. She also revealed the real reason behind the child-free rule: it wasn’t directed at all kids. The bride had been trying to avoid having her mother-in-law’s grandchildren there because they had been “nightmares” at other events, as described by the bride herself. The bride didn’t want to cause any more drama by openly sharing that reason, so she kept it under the radar.

I feel a lot better knowing that my friend still supports my decision, and I’m relieved that the real issue wasn’t about me or Amelia. While I’ll definitely be more cautious with similar situations in the future, I’m glad I prioritized Amelia’s safety and wellbeing. Thanks again to everyone who shared their thoughts—I truly appreciate it.","AITA for Bringing My Daughter to a Child-Free Wedding?

He sleeps through all of his alarms, which usually means he is late for work. Sometimes it´s only 10-15 minutes, but it can also stretch to 1 hour. His boss likes him and has given him plenty of chances, but yesterday he got his last warning that if he doesn´t show up on time he will lose his job.

We have had a couple of discussions/arguments about this over the last year because he believes it´s my responsibility, as his girlfriend, to wake him up. But I don´t. Despite me waking up from his alarms and being able to shove him out of bed (if need be), I don´t think it´s my responsibility. He is an adult, has known about his adhd since he was a child, and should by now have found some method that works. Him making it my responsibility turns me into a caregiver, a mother, instead of a girlfriend.

This doesn´t mean I refuse to help him whatsoever. I have done plenty of research to find alternative methods, but either it didn´t work or he refuses to do it. And I do wake him when his alarms go off, but he decides to go back to sleep right after. Had he not done that, I would gladly wake him up every single day. And I know this is only my perspective, and is most likely not true from his, but when he decides to just go back to sleep it makes it seem like he doesn´t want to try. Not to mention the fact that he is especially grumpy/angry in the mornings and have, on several occasions, yelled at me for both waking him up and for not waking him up. And I don´t want to help if he is just going to get mad (even though I know he doesn´t mean it).

But when his boss gave him his last warning yesterday, I felt so much guilt. Because had I just woken him up, and been persistent, he wouldn´t be in this situation. So I am at an impasse. Is it my responsibility, am I in the wrong for not helping, or should he, as an adult, be able to do this by himself? Because I kinda feel like the AH, but also not.

EDIT: I feel like I should mention more to the reason I don´t want to wake him up. It´s not like I can´t, since I´m already awake, but first of all this affects my day too. I can´t go to sleep before him, because our bedroom doesn´t have a door (small apartment) so if he´s watching tv or gaming it keeps me awake. This means I don´t get enough sleep either, so when I have to do uni work during the day (before I have work in the evenings) I zone out and usually fall asleep (physically can´t keep my eyes open). Which is why I wish I could keep sleeping for an hour or so longer, without having to worry if he got up or not. 

But I also don´t want this responsibility because I love him. I want him to be independent, and I know we´re in a relationship and we´re supposed to depend on each other. And we do. But I don´t want him to depend on me to get him to work on time, or to keep his economy in check or anything that would turn his life upside down should we break up. I need to know he can take care of himself in case something happens. 

EDIT 2: Not much of an update, but I talked to him yesterday and he has come to the realization himself that it's not my responsibility. He felt that way because he felt like a failure for not being able to do it, so like a lot of you said it was easier to blame me. We did agree to try the wake-up light so hopefully that will work. I am not breaking up with him. I love him and want to keep helping him. I made this post because I was unsure if I should've done more, or if the fact that he had taken no personal responsibility to make a change means I did all I could. He is well aware that he is the only one who can make a change. Neither I nor a psychologist can make that change for him. He hasn't until a couple years ago tried to genuinely take control so it makes sense that he's still finding methods that work. But I suggested both a psychologist and finding other people with the same diagnoses as him so he has someone to talk to. Hopefully we'll figure it out together. Of course I will be there for him, help him find methods, and be there if they fail. But making the effort to change is something he has to do himself. 
I apologize if it seemed like I was trying to make myself a victim as some of you pointed out. That was not my intention. I never know what type of info is vital so a lot more came out because of your comments, and me not being good at describing to the degree that is needed means a lot goes unsaid and miscommunication happens.

Him making it my responsibility turns me into a caregiver, a mother, instead of a girlfriend.

This doesn´t mean I refuse to help him whatsoever. I have done plenty of research to find alternative methods, but either it didn´t work or he refuses to do it. And I do wake him when his alarms go off, but he decides to go back to sleep right after. Had he not done that, I would gladly wake him up every single day. And I know this is only my perspective, and is most likely not true from his, but when he decides to just go back to sleep it makes it seem like he doesn´t want to try. Not to mention the fact that he is especially grumpy/angry in the mornings and have, on several occasions, yelled at me for both waking him up and for not waking him up. And I don´t want to help if he is just going to get mad (even though I know he doesn´t mean it).

But when his boss gave him his last warning yesterday, I felt so much guilt. Because had I just woken him up, and been persistent, he wouldn´t be in this situation. So I am at an impasse. Is it my responsibility, am I in the wrong for not helping, or should he, as an adult, be able to do this by himself? Because I kinda feel like the AH, but also not.

EDIT: I feel like I should mention more to the reason I don´t want to wake him up. It´s not like I can´t, since I´m already awake, but first of all this affects my day too. I can´t go to sleep before him, because our bedroom doesn´t have a door (small apartment) so if he´s watching tv or gaming it keeps me awake. This means I don´t get enough sleep either, so when I have to do uni work during the day (before I have work in the evenings) I zone out and usually fall asleep (physically can´t keep my eyes open). Which is why I wish I could keep sleeping for an hour or so longer, without having to worry if he got up or not. 

But I also don´t want this responsibility because I love him. I want him to be independent, and I know we´re in a relationship and we´re supposed to depend on each other. And we do. But I don´t want him to depend on me to get him to work on time, or to keep his economy in check or anything that would turn his life upside down should we break up. I need to know he can take care of himself in case something happens. 

EDIT 2: Not much of an update, but I talked to him yesterday and he has come to the realization himself that it's not my responsibility. He felt that way because he felt like a failure for not being able to do it, so like a lot of you said it was easier to blame me. We did agree to try the wake-up light so hopefully that will work. I am not breaking up with him. I love him and want to keep helping him. I made this post because I was unsure if I should've done more, or if the fact that he had taken no personal responsibility to make a change means I did all I could. He is well aware that he is the only one who can make a change. Neither I nor a psychologist can make that change for him. He hasn't until a couple years ago tried to genuinely take control so it makes sense that he's still finding methods that work. But I suggested both a psychologist and finding other people with the same diagnoses as him so he has someone to talk to. Hopefully we'll figure it out together. Of course I will be there for him, help him find methods, and be there if they fail. But making the effort to change is something he has to do himself.

I’m 52F and this situation concerns my husband’s brother “Drew” (59M) and his wife of 5 years “Susanne” (35F). Drew supports Susanne on his income while she focuses on her dream of being an artist. She makes paintings of people and animals, and has a website where she advertises her work for sale.  
  
Privately, I don’t think her art is very good. It’s absolutely better than what I could do, but it doesn’t look “professional,” if you know what I mean. My husband feels the same, so we have not opted to purchase any of her art, despite her dropping hints here and there about it.  
  
The art on her site is priced in the $3-5K range. I realize that labor and cost of materials must be taken into account, but given the quality, those prices seem outrageous to me. I suspect she’s not making regular sales, because she started making portraits of friends, family, or pets “as a surprise,” and usually, said family and friends end up feeling obligated to buy the painting as a courtesy. Unfortunately, my husband and I were the latest victims of this sales tactic.  
  
My son recently proposed to his girlfriend, and we took the two of them, his girlfriend's parents, and our daughter out to a fancy dinner to celebrate. Both my kids posted pictures from dinner on social media. Without telling anyone, Susanne decided to make a painting of one of these pictures, of everyone smiling for the camera. She revealed the big “surprise” at a party she and Drew hosted two weeks ago. The painting is a whopping 40x58”, and I honestly think it’s awful... kitsch and tacky.  
  
I told Susanne it was sweet of her to commemorate such a special moment in our family, but I carefully avoided saying anything about “liking” it. As I feared, she kept dropping hints throughout the party about how we can buy it as a wedding gift, and she would be happy to give us a big discount off what she would charge someone else. (Who else would buy it?) I politely dodged these hints, and she was clearly disappointed.  
  
Over the weekend, Drew reached out to my husband to say that Susanne feels hurt that we never made an offer. He said it’s becoming obvious as the years go by that we’ve never purchased one of her pieces, even though we have the means to do so, and it would mean a lot to them if we buy the painting. Her original asking price was $2.5K, and Drew said he’ll reduce it further to $1900.  
  
It's not about the money (not entirely.) It’s the principle of the thing. I feel like I’m being strongarmed into paying for something I never asked for, don’t like, and don’t have space for in my house. I asked, and my son and his fiancée don’t want it. My husband thinks we should just buy it to keep the peace in the family and avoid a potential rift with Susanne and Drew.

He’s thrown things and punched through walls, but never physically harmed her, she says (although who knows how things might’ve progressed had she stayed).

She said of course. Unfortunately when we went to drop him off, she wasn’t home and one of my husband’s sisters Jane (21) was instead. Apparently my mil wasn’t going to be home for a bit so she (Jane) agreed to watch our son for some time. 

I immediately said no because well Jane believes that babies don’t feel anything. She thinks that they cry for no reason and we shouldn’t respond to their cries ever for whatever reason. And that not responding won’t have any effect on them. She thinks that anything we do to babies during this period of their lives will have absolutely 0 effect on them in the future. She will often call them mindless too.

My husband called his mom and we politely explained our concerns and then hung up because we were extremely busy already (and now we had to find another babysitter as well). 

I figured that was it until Jane came over extremely upset and in tears insisting that she’s not a bad person and that she would never do anything to hurt any kid. She then accused me of “discriminating” against her because she doesn’t want/have kids like everyone else in the family. I told her straight up that I don’t give a crap if she wants kids of her own, but I don’t like her thoughts on how to care for babies specifically. Instead of trying to understand me, she doubled down and said that her way of dealing with babies makes sense and that I’m wrong and I’m just extremely sensitive in nature so of course I don’t get it. 

She kept arguing with me about how to take care of my baby so I just asked her to leave and she blew up on me. My husband even told her to calm down and that it’s not like we’re preventing her from seeing our kids all together but she just went “fuck you and your dumb ass kids” and left. Which… okay… ?

My husband and I had to be somewhere for our older child so we asked my mil if she could watch our 3 month old son for a few hours. She said of course. Unfortunately when we went to drop him off, she wasn’t home and one of my husband’s sisters Jane (21) was instead. Apparently my mil wasn’t going to be home for a bit so she (Jane) agreed to watch our son for some time. 

I immediately said no because well Jane believes that babies don’t feel anything. She thinks that they cry for no reason and we shouldn’t respond to their cries ever for whatever reason. And that not responding won’t have any effect on them. She thinks that anything we do to babies during this period of their lives will have absolutely 0 effect on them in the future. She will often call them mindless too.

My husband called his mom and we politely explained our concerns and then hung up because we were extremely busy already (and now we had to find another babysitter as well). 

I figured that was it until Jane came over extremely upset and in tears insisting that she’s not a bad person and that she would never do anything to hurt any kid. She then accused me of “discriminating” against her because she doesn’t want/have kids like everyone else in the family. I told her straight up that I don’t give a crap if she wants kids of her own, but I don’t like her thoughts on how to care for babies specifically.

My son immediatly agreed, spat out the blueberries (in the garbage can) and started eating an apple.

This, much to my wives dismay. She said i overruled her authority and that my son will never learn to eat healthy. My reply was that it is not ok to force a child (or any other person) to eat something they don't like (especially after they tasted it). How would she feel if I forced her to eat something she doens't like? Why is it ok for her to not eat certain foods but not for our son? He likes enough vegetables and fruit in order to get a balanced diet so I think we should meet him halfway and not focus on forcing him to eat stuff we know he doesn't like (and he is not really a fussy eater so we have plenty of healthy stuff to choose from).

The situation escalated and at one point my son even said ""i'll just eat the blueberries"", in an attempt to de-escalate our argument (after which he took three blueberries from the fridge and swallowing them almost whole just to get it over with). Sadly for him, it didn't really work because we were already to far into the argument (although i did thank him afterwards for trying and apoligized for not being able to let it slide).

Am i the asshole because I didn't force my son to eat the blueberries and allowed him to take another piece of fruit he does like?

  
Edit : I wasn't expecting such a big response and haven't been able to read all comments. Thanks to everyone who responded, i really appreciate the advice.

","AITA for not forcing my child to eat blueberries?Today my wife gave our 11 year old son some blueberries. My son said that he rather not eat them because he doesn't really like blueberries. My wife replied ""but these are really good"" so my son hesitantly tried one blueberry and replied ""Thx, but I still don't like them and rather not eat the rest"". I thought that was the end of it and went to the store to get groceries for diner.

When i came back my son was crying at the table because he was forced to eat the remaining three blueberries.

She told me it was gross and that she didn’t want to be stepping all over my waste when she went to the bathroom. Keep in mind we live in a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom studio apartment.

I can’t say I blame you though, if I read a post this insane I would probably think the same thing. Unfortunately, This is something very real that I am dealing with and I was simply looking for some guidance.


To give some backstory, I (19F, white) have been living with my college roommate (19F, Hispanic) for the past two years. Last year, our dorm building only had community bathrooms, so I was completely unaware of her bathroom habits as we did not share this space.

Fast forward to the current school year, we now have our own apartment where the two of us share a bathroom. After about a week and a half of living together, I started to notice a foul odor coming from our bathroom. I spent hours scrubbing the shower, sink, toilet, floor, and counters, but the smell did not go away. I convinced myself that it must have been the sink releasing some trapped gas from the pipes or something. I submitted a work order to have the drain looked at and called it a day. 

Another week goes by and the smell is almost unbearable. Maintenance still hasn’t come, so I open the cupboard underneath the sink to try and have a look for myself. When I open the door, my nose is violated by an odor one can only describe as a porta-potty that has been sitting in full sun on the hottest day in July. I now realize where the stench is coming from as my eyes fall onto the trash can underneath the sink that is completely overflown with brown and yellow stained toilet paper. I walk directly over to my roommate’s bedroom and confront her about this. 

I ask why she has been throwing her used toilet paper into our trash can rather than flushing it down the toilet. She tells me that it is “Mexican culture” and I wouldn’t understand. I have never heard of this in my life so I continue to question her about it. She tells me that everyone in Mexico throws their used toilet paper in the trash because the septic systems there aren’t designed to withstand toilet paper being flushed down them. 

I believe myself to be a very understanding person but this is just completely bizarre to me because my roommate has lived in the USA her entire life and has never even been to Mexico. I asked her if she wouldn’t mind flushing her toilet paper in our apartment due to the horrific stench that had built up over the first few weeks. She tells me that this is a part of her culture and she doesn’t appreciate the fact that I am not respecting it. She has been acting extremely standoffish and rude towards me since our conversation and I don’t know what do do.

One of my good friends, Matthew (26M) is getting married next month to Jennifer (26F). I (25F) have known Matthew since high school. We’ve both connected when it came to video games, especially Minecraft. Matthew has had his fair share of girlfriends over the years but when he met Jennifer 3 years ago, he said that he knew she was the one and they are madly in love with each other and I am so happy for them both. 

Last year, Matthew popped the question to Jennifer and she said yes. Jennifer’s demeanor towards me drastically changed after the engagement. She was distant towards me, she wouldn’t look at me and she would hardly speak to me which was weird since Jennifer was always so sweet and nice towards me. 

I’d still talk to Matthew and meet with him and our group of friends, sometimes with Jennifer and she would still act cold and not speak to me much. I kept my distance from Jennifer. Three months ago, we all received a save the date invitation and their wedding is going to take place at Matthew’s cabin 2 hours away and they were going to keep it small due to the size of the cabin so we were only allowed to bring one guest. That was when Jennifer acted extremely harsh and hostile towards me and said “bet you don’t have a plus one since you are so into my man.” I was taken aback. I asked her what the fuck she was talking about and she smirked and said I knew and to not act stupid. I ignored her remark and told her my boyfriend was coming. She looked surprised and left. I of course told Matthew about what Jennifer said to me and he was not happy, so he made her apologize to me. 

Then, last weekend, I was invited by matthew’s sister to go dress shopping with her and Jennifer. I declined at first because I wanted to keep my distance from Jennifer but Matthew’s sister assured me that she will deal with Jennifer and that our other friends will be there with us. So we go dress shopping and I found a beautiful dress that I thought would be perfect and I took a picture to send to my boyfriend since he planned on matching (I.e with a bow tie) with me. I tried the dress on and it was a perfect fit so I guess I got lucky. Jennifer was angry, called me names such as a whore, a boyfriend stealing bitch, and that I was officially uninvited to the wedding. She caused such a commotion, the employee of the store asked us to leave. 

I told Jennifer I didn’t want to come to the wedding anyway but I was going to because MY FRIEND was getting married. I told her if she didn’t want me at the wedding, fine. I don’t give a fuck since I won’t go to a wedding if the bride is going to be so rude to a guest. 

Matthew and our friends found out and I was getting texts left and right begging me to just come to the wedding. I told them I was happy to get uninvited and I’ll just spend the day with my boyfriend on the day of the wedding instead. They’re all mad at me for not fighting hard enough. 

AITA?

Edit: so my decision is final. I will not be going to the wedding and there’s no changing my mind about it. I will be sending a wedding gift to Matthew the day prior to the wedding instead. I told Matthew and all my friends that I won’t be going and they can’t convince me otherwise. Matthew also called me and asked if we can talk somewhere. I agreed but it’s to tell him in person that I won’t go so that way he knows I’m serious about that. 

Update: I met up with Matthew and brought my boyfriend along. Of course, he begged me to come to the wedding and he said he would beg Jennifer to let me attend. I told him it’s best if I wasn’t there. I told Matthew that Jennifer has a problem with me. Period. He said he doesn’t understand and he did ask her many times but Jennifer would continue to say she was just “stressed”. I got angry and said that’s bullshit and he knows that. My boyfriend also intervened and said to Matthew that he needs to wake up and realize Jennifer is crazy and he can’t keep defending her. Matthew said he loves her too much and doesn’t want to lose her. My boyfriend and I got up and told Matthew to let us know when he has a backbone. In the meantime, it’s best we don’t talk. I messaged all of our friends in the group to let them know I’m keeping a distance from Matthew because of Jennifer. He’s still my friend but at an arms length. I will still be sending him a gift regardless but I’m keeping my distance from Matthew. It seems like he is in denial and can’t comprehend what’s going on at all. He usually is in denial, ever since high school he would have a sense of denial. 

Another thing to mention is that Jennifer is nice to all of Matthew’s female friends. Just not with me. I’ve also gotten a message from two of our friends saying they have dropped out of attending the wedding because of Jennifer and that they are on my side. 

Edit 2: Jennifer already bought her wedding dress a while ago. When I went dress shopping with Matthew’s sister, she invited Jennifer as a way to resolve this animosity she had towards me. So it was Matthew’s sister who wanted to buy a dress and I found a dress that I loved and Jennifer went crazy. Hope that clears things up since so many were confused.

For my whole life, I (30F) have had a lot of anxiety when it comes to driving. It has never been too much of a problem, as I live in a city and I can walk wherever I need to go I have been married to my husband, ""Stan"" (32M) for three years, together for six. Throughout our relationship, he has tried to help me learn how to drive. The problem is, Stan is not a very good teacher amd gets very impatient, and angry everytime we try. We go to the parking lot of an abandoned warehouse sometimes, it's huge. Anyway, if I make one small mistake, for example, if i don't check my mirrors for a long enough time. Stan yells at me. 

I would already BE nervous at the wheel, but with all the yelling, it would cause me to break down and cry. I have a brother, Paul (33M) who I hang out with typically once a week. A few months ago,  I was talking to Paul about how I want to learn how to drive, but I'm very nervous about it. He offered to help teach me when we hang out. Paul's husband, Chris also was willing to help me out, and they actually made me feel so much more at ease behind the wheel. I thought I was bad at driving, but it turns out, I was just anxious. 

Another factor that made me want to learn besides feeling like I need to do this, is that Stan has told me that he won't have a child with me until I get my license, which I definitely understand. Two weeks ago, on my day off from work, Paul and Chris took me to the DMV and I finally got my license!! I also bought a used car a few days ago from money that I've been saving up for years. I'm so happy and I have has the support from my brother and his husband. 

I thought Stan would be mad that I did all of this behind his back. And he was somewhat disappointed that I didn't want his help. I love him so much, but honestly he wasn't the right teacher for me. 

Anyway, on Sunday, Stan and I both had off from work and he told me he had a surprise for me. He took me to his parents house, where they had a celebration for me, basically like a little party congratulating me because I learned how to drive. Halfway through, my mother in law was giving a speech about how proud she was of me, but also proud of my husband, for all of thr support and lessons he was giving me. I could feel the anger rising in my chest. Stan had been telling everyone that HE was the one who has been teaching me to drive. I snapped and told everyone, basically that the fee times Stan tried to teach me, I always ended up crying because he would yell at me until he was blue in the face. That the ONLY people who helped me and gave me confidence were Paul and Chris. And that, if anything... Stan made things worse for me. Which was true. But now, Stan won't talk to me.

It is always crowded (coffee shop noise helps me focus), so I show up at opening time (8am), order some food and a drink, and stay for 2-3 hours.

Even though I go on my own, I always sit at a 2 person table, as the counters are uncomfortable for me and they do not have much space. I also like sitting against the wall so that people walking by can’t see my computer screen.

Yesterday at \~9am, I was doing work at a table when a random woman sat across from me. This ticked me off because I don’t like my personal space being invaded, and I would have appreciated it if she had asked me before sitting down, but I ignored it. I was near the counter that day, so she might have just been waiting for her food. As I looked up, I noticed she was talking to another woman in the line to order (we’ll call the first woman Beatrice and the second woman Suzy). Suzy was saying how they might have to take their food to go because no tables were available. Beatrice didn’t address me directly, but she gestured to me, as if planning to take over my table. This ticked me off more because it was like I was an object that could be moved, but I knew when the time came I would ask them not to sit at my table.

Sure enough, Suzy got the order in and brought her number to my table. She then asked if I wouldn’t mind moving to the counters so that her friend could sit here, saying her friend had recently had back surgery and the counters would be too uncomfortable for her. I told her no–the counters are uncomfortable for me too, and there would not be enough space for all of my books and notebooks. She called me rude and inconsiderate and said I shouldn’t even be there because I wasn’t eating anything. I said I had bought breakfast and a drink, not that it was their business, and that they could take things to go. Eventually, one of the workers came over and asked if they were bothering me. I said they were, and Beatrice and Suzy were asked to leave.

When I got home, I recounted the story to my roommate. I thought she would be as horrified as I was by their behavior, but she was hesitant to take a side. She said their behavior was rude and entitled, but at the same time I was taking up a table at a notoriously busy cafe for a long time and I could have moved. Later, my sister likened it to not giving up a seat to a disabled person on public transit. This I don’t agree with because transportation is a NEED for a lot of people, and these people didn’t NEED to sit down at this café. Also, maybe this is asshole-y of me, but I think a lot of people say they have back issues or some other mild condition just to get things they want. Both my sister and my roommate said it was a “they had to BE there” kind of situation for them to decide, so I’m wondering if any of you can decide if I’m TA without having been there?","AITA for refusing to give up my table in a coffee shop for a woman who supposedly was recovering from back surgery?On Saturday mornings I study at a café.

As I looked up, I noticed she was talking to another woman in the line to order (we’ll call the first woman Beatrice and the second woman Suzy). Suzy was saying how they might have to take their food to go because no tables were available. Beatrice didn’t address me directly, but she gestured to me, as if planning to take over my table. This ticked me off more because it was like I was an object that could be moved, but I knew when the time came I would ask them not to sit at my table.

Sure enough, Suzy got the order in and brought her number to my table. She then asked if I wouldn’t mind moving to the counters so that her friend could sit here, saying her friend had recently had back surgery and the counters would be too uncomfortable for her. I told her no–the counters are uncomfortable for me too, and there would not be enough space for all of my books and notebooks. She called me rude and inconsiderate and said I shouldn’t even be there because I wasn’t eating anything. I said I had bought breakfast and a drink, not that it was their business, and that they could take things to go. Eventually, one of the workers came over and asked if they were bothering me. I said they were, and Beatrice and Suzy were asked to leave.

When I got home, I recounted the story to my roommate. I thought she would be as horrified as I was by their behavior, but she was hesitant to take a side. She said their behavior was rude and entitled, but at the same time I was taking up a table at a notoriously busy cafe for a long time and I could have moved. Later, my sister likened it to not giving up a seat to a disabled person on public transit. This I don’t agree with because transportation is a NEED for a lot of people, and these people didn’t NEED to sit down at this café. Also, maybe this is asshole-y of me, but I think a lot of people say they have back issues or some other mild condition just to get things they want. Both my sister and my roommate said it was a “they had to BE there” kind of situation for them to decide, so I’m wondering if any of you can decide if I’m TA without having been there?",False,False,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to give up my table in a coffee shop for a woman who supposedly was recovering from back surgery?,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1epm0xt/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_table_in_a_coffee/

I'll try to keep it as short as I can. I promise I'll clarify things if there are confusions and sorry about them in advance!

I'm 21F and I have 2 siblings. My sister is 24 and engaged. My brother is 28 and married to my sister in law who is 25.

My parents hosted a family luncheon to celebrate my sister's engagement at their house. I went early to help them set up, my brother and sister in law a little bit later then everyone else. My sister and her fiancé arrived last.

Everything was going well and everyone was happy until my sister got a text and pulled me aside. She asked me if I could go outside and meet a friend's of hers who's going to drop off something off for her. I did. The 'something' was a big ball of pure happiness, a Saint Bernard dog with a cute little formal tie around his neck.

As adorable as he was, I couldn't bring him in because my sister in law is allergic. Her allergy is not severe but still. Everyone in the family knows of it. I told the friend to please wait while I talk to my sister, she did not. I texted my sister that I can't bring him inside. She texted that it was fine, to bring it in because it's a surprise and he's the newest addition to the family. I insisted that I can't then I texted my brother about it because it had been 10 minutes, I'm standing in the driveway with a big doggie that would not stop licking my legs, not knowing what to do.

From what I was told, inside, my brother pulled my sister aside and asked her not to bring the dog in. That she knows his wife is allergic. She refused, saying that it's an open space, that sister in law will be fine. He then told her the news that sister in law is pregnant. (I already knew and they were waiting until she passed her first trimester.)

My sister then went outside, dragged the dog and then me in when I resisted. My brother, seeing this, excused himself and left with sister in law. 

We tried resuming the lunch after that but it was awkward at best. When my sister and her fiancé cut the cake, she grabbed her glass of champagne to make a toast. The 'toast' was her rambling about how selfish my brother and his wife were, that they couldn't let her have one day to herself and had to ruin and overshadow it. That they were not the first or last couple to get pregnant. Both of my parents tried to shush her but she was on a roll and went on to call sister in law an attention seeker that just had to give the family the first grandchild.

I finally had enough and told her that green isn't a good look on her and that she was going to choke on her jealousy one day. Then I got up and left.

She called me a bitch on my way out. My mom called me after and told me that it was a bit harsh even if she was harsher. She also suggested that the three of us (siblings) talk it out after things settle a bit. My dad is staying neutral. I haven't heard from relatives that were at the luncheon. 

AITA?

I didn't expect my dad to do anything, he offered to take me gokarting, saying he would prefer to do that over the water park anyway. If he didn't want to, that's totally fine.

My parents tried calling me at 9 a.m twice, and when I didn't answer (I wear earplugs to bed because my cats do cat things at night), my Dad decided to just come on in at 9:30. 
My dog, who was in my room with me, started to loose his mind which woke me up. I sleep naked. After pulling out my earplugs I could tell that there was someone in my house, and obviously I was terrified. I grabbed my intruder blaster and poked my head out of my bedroom door to my Dad in my living room. 
I was still half asleep, so I don't exactly know what I yelled at him besides ""Of course I didn't answer you! It's 9 in the morning!"" And ""Get out! I'm naked, what is wrong with you? Get out!"" But I feel bad now. 
After he left I tried to call back my mom but she didn't answer.

I texted her back saying that I didn't know what about my Aunt coming down to visit made them lose their manners about my house (they acted up in a different way last year when she came to visit), but that they needed to cool it.
I did not go to the event because no further information was given to me after they left. I assume that they had intended to come pick me up this morning so that we could carpool, but when I yelled at them they decided to go without me. I could have driven myself if they had given me the time and address where we could meet.
I'm pissed because I missed out on a beach trip with friends to see my Aunt, little cousin, and nephew this weekend, and just like last year they're acting like everyone should bend over backwards to accommodate them for their last minute decisions.

My parents tried calling me at 9 a.m twice, and when I didn't answer (I wear earplugs to bed because my cats do cat things at night), my Dad decided to just come on in at 9:30. 
My dog, who was in my room with me, started to loose his mind which woke me up. I sleep naked. After pulling out my earplugs I could tell that there was someone in my house, and obviously I was terrified. I grabbed my intruder blaster and poked my head out of my bedroom door to my Dad in my living room. 
I was still half asleep, so I don't exactly know what I yelled at him besides ""Of course I didn't answer you! It's 9 in the morning!"" And ""Get out! I'm naked, what is wrong with you? Get out!"" But I feel bad now. 
After he left I tried to call back my mom but she didn't answer. Eventually I got a text from her ""apologizing"" for scaring me but apparently they were just so worried that I hadn't answered their calls and texts at 9 a.m on a Sunday that they had come over, and had been knocking on my door and my windows before deciding to come in. 
I texted her back saying that I didn't know what about my Aunt coming down to visit made them lose their manners about my house (they acted up in a different way last year when she came to visit), but that they needed to cool it.
I did not go to the event because no further information was given to me after they left. I assume that they had intended to come pick me up this morning so that we could carpool, but when I yelled at them they decided to go without me. I could have driven myself if they had given me the time and address where we could meet.
I'm pissed because I missed out on a beach trip with friends to see my Aunt, little cousin, and nephew this weekend, and just like last year they're acting like everyone should bend over backwards to accommodate them for their last minute decisions.

My mom and stepmother did not get along at all. I remember feeling the tension between them. I remember hearing my stepmother grumble to dad about mom if I had to go to their house instead of home with mom after they had all been in the same place. It was extra bad if they all showed up to my dance recitals. My stepmother wanted to be the one doing some of the dance stuff. She used to tell my dad she didn't think she'd have much in common with a young boy but dance could be our thing and mom was hogging it by always being there. Mom was the person who signed me up for dance. Dad wasn't on board back that. He's a bit too macho dude for that.

My mom's original letter made my stepmother so angry though. I never called my stepmother 'mom' or anything. I never call her my parent either. I know she technically is. But I always disliked the idea of her being called that because she hated mom so much and felt like mom needed to step back from stuff to let her take over them (like dance). My stepmother is pissed that my mom never mentioned her in the letter and that mom never asked me to let her (stepmother) in. She felt like mom put up a final wall between us and made sure she would always be the outsider in my eyes and I would always long for my mom and reject her as a mother figure. Our relationship is really tense while things with my dad are better than they were when I was younger. He got softer. So he said the three of us should go to therapy together to figure stuff out.

After two months of therapy my stepmother wants the letter brought into sessions and the counselor feels like that's a good idea and we should discuss the content of it since it's such a point of tension. But I don't want my stepmother anywhere near it. She's poison when it comes to my mom and I don't want her to taint it. The counselor told me it would only benefit us all. My stepmother got mad and said even a piece of paper is more important to me than she is. We had two sessions since and I did not bring it. This made my stepmother's anger worse.

This is not what she wants. She wants me to take on more of the chores we agreed would be hers. On top of earning all the money, and all the chores I currently have. 

I asked her what she wanted me to do. She gave me a list. I hired a cleaning service and paid for it out of our budget before splitting the fun money.

Now she says that I'm an asshole and being financially abusive.

My twin is very social and has a bigger group of friends that he hangs out with all the time since most of them go to the same college. 

Last week when we were hanging out with some of our mutual friends from highschool one of them made a comment about my shirt, saying it looked like one my brother had in highschool. I told her it was the same shirt and she gave me a kind of weird look. I brushed it off because I didn't think she meant anything by it. My brother and I sometimes share clothes because we have a similar enough style and are about the same height and build. For us it just means we have a lot more clothing options. 

Yesterday, I ran into that same friend after one of my classes and we stopped to talk. My brother called me in the middle of our conversation to ask if I wanted food since he was ordering anyway and before I hung up I said ""Bye, I love you."" He said it back and my friend gave me a strange look. She didnt say anything at first but then when I asked her what was wrong she said it was just strange that I said I love you to my brother. I laughed it off and asked her if she didnt say it to her siblings. She said no because that was weird. 

I didn't know what to say so I just left it there and told her I needed to go so I could meet J at home before he left for his friends house since they were planning on hanging out. She then started talking about how weird our relationship was and how it wasn't normal for siblings to share clothes or say i love you, hug, hang out so much or do any of the things we do. And how highchool was weird since we were always together and talking to eachother. 

She also brought up a comment I made in highschool In response to a question about what I woud do if my twin died. I said that I didn't think I could live without him because he was a part of me. This question was asked to another set of twins we were friends with and they both had the same answer. 

The whole time she was going on, i just stared at her because I really couldnt believe what I was hearing. Eventually she stopped and I just blurted out, ""You know you should really stop watching so much p*rn."" 

She was very embarassed and went off at me for saying that. I just left and went home.

My twin is very social and has a bigger group of friends that he hangs out with all the time since most of them go to the same college. 

Last week when we were hanging out with some of our mutual friends from highschool one of them made a comment about my shirt, saying it looked like one my brother had in highschool. I told her it was the same shirt and she gave me a kind of weird look. I brushed it off because I didn't think she meant anything by it. My brother and I sometimes share clothes because we have a similar enough style and are about the same height and build. For us it just means we have a lot more clothing options. 

Yesterday, I ran into that same friend after one of my classes and we stopped to talk. My brother called me in the middle of our conversation to ask if I wanted food since he was ordering anyway and before I hung up I said ""Bye, I love you."" He said it back and my friend gave me a strange look. She didnt say anything at first but then when I asked her what was wrong she said it was just strange that I said I love you to my brother. I laughed it off and asked her if she didnt say it to her siblings. She said no because that was weird. 

I didn't know what to say so I just left it there and told her I needed to go so I could meet J at home before he left for his friends house since they were planning on hanging out. She then started talking about how weird our relationship was and how it wasn't normal for siblings to share clothes or say i love you, hug, hang out so much or do any of the things we do. And how highchool was weird since we were always together and talking to eachother. 

She also brought up a comment I made in highschool In response to a question about what I woud do if my twin died. I said that I didn't think I could live without him because he was a part of me. This question was asked to another set of twins we were friends with and they both had the same answer. 

The whole time she was going on, i just stared at her because I really couldnt believe what I was hearing. Eventually she stopped and I just blurted out, ""You know you should really stop watching so much p*rn."" 

She was very embarassed and went off at me for saying that. I just left and went home. I told J what happened and he just laughed at me while I felt like I was dying inside because I couldnt believe I said that. I asked my friends what they thought and they laughed at me and told me i'm not the asshole but I still feel like am. So AITA?

I started ordering my own meals to bring to the parties. They got upset when they realized what I was doing. I explained that I LIKE ordering my own food, because it's a chance to get a treat for myself that I don't normally order.

AITA for buying my own take out instead of what's being served at the party?

EDIT because there's questions: 

My partner is ALWAYS supportive of me and would never try to make me eat something I didn't like. He does stand up for me and tells them, just like I do, that I just don't like that place. (He's a lot more confident about standing up than I am, tbh) But even when HE gets them to back down, the issue is brought back up the very next time we eat together. 

And yes, we were planning on hosting and cooking everything. We'd actually bought all of the ingredients already. But when she gets upset it's a whole big thing that could last for days and ruin the whole party, so it's really a ""pick your battles"" thing. Have everyone together for Halloween? Or have a silly fight over pasta vs. pizza and miss Halloween altogether trying to do damage control.

AITA for buying my own take out instead of what's being served at the party?

EDIT because there's questions: 

My partner is ALWAYS supportive of me and would never try to make me eat something I didn't like. He does stand up for me and tells them, just like I do, that I just don't like that place. (He's a lot more confident about standing up than I am, tbh) But even when HE gets them to back down, the issue is brought back up the very next time we eat together. 

And yes, we were planning on hosting and cooking everything. We'd actually bought all of the ingredients already. But when she gets upset it's a whole big thing that could last for days and ruin the whole party, so it's really a ""pick your battles"" thing. Have everyone together for Halloween? Or have a silly fight over pasta vs. pizza and miss Halloween altogether trying to do damage control.

My 26M sister Emma 29F was very sick in high school. Her choice was either to die young or be able to conceive children. It was a hard decision for her and she doesn't like to talk about it.

She has been dating Adam 29M for about 6 years and he is really nice. The whole family loves him. He proposed to her last year and they were planning to marry in March next year. But here is the problem, Adam really wants children. He always plays around with our little cousins at family events and talks about what he wants to do and teach his future children. We always thought that they were just going to be adopting so we never brought it up. But since the engagement I have noticed that he always talks about them as their children, as in biological. I don't know how to explain it but it didn't seem like they were going to adopt a child. After thinking about it for a while I decided to talk with Emma about it. I asked her out and gently brought up the topic. She did seem a bit angry about me mentioning it but she explained to me that Adam treats adaption the same as giving birth and that he is happy all the same. It sounded believed, but I know my sister, she was lying. During the entire conversation she could not look me in the eye.

After a month I finally decided to talk to Adam. This Sunday we were gathered at my parents house for dinner and while everyone was busy and we were alone I asked Adam how the adoption proceedings were going. Were they going to start now or after they got married. He looked surprised,and asked me what I was talking about. I mentioned how he wants many kids so they should probably be starting with the whole process early. He asked me if Emma wants to abopt a child because they had never talked about it. Since my parents were coming back I asked him to talk to me later.

Around the end of dinner I asked him for some help with my phone and lead him to the balcony and I was honest with him. I asked him if he new that Emma can't have children. At first he thought I was joking, but when he saw that I was serious he got this dead look on his face. I told him some of the details and said that it would probably be best if he talked with Emma for the full story. He was quite for the rest of the evening.

When they got how they apparently got in a major fight. I know that he is currently staying with friends and asked for the ring back but nothing else.

In the last two years that we've done this, the 3 people in management who have been given the gifts have come down to our office and thanked that one person (F56) profusely for her generosity and how sweet she was to do this etc.. Last year, I asked her if she gave something from just her as well and if that was why they thanked only her? She said no, but since she was the one who handed the gift basket to them and wrote the card (there were 3 others inc. me who built the actual baskets, she just insisted on doing the card), they maybe misunderstood (note that she always does this first thing in the morning and will take the basket from our office and go up by herself regardless if people say they'd like to join her, and just say she ""forgot"" they wanted to come with)...

Well, I checked with one of the assistants because I am petty. The assistant told me that while the card said that it was from the staff, it did say ""*name of the lady* and the rest of the staff"", and that the same thing had happened the year before.

At the time, I did not say anything and just made a note of it for this year.

Now, here's where I may have been a bit of an AH: This year, this lady once again sent out an email asking everyone to contribute a minimum of $30/per person for these 3 people. One of the owners retired earlier in the year, but she felt he'd still really appreciate a gift. I answered the email and said: ""Dear *name*, thank you for reaching out regarding this. I have given a lot of thought to this throughout the year, and have decided to organize my own gift this year instead with a smaller amount as it’s been a tough year financially for me and many others. Perhaps you can edit last year's card to say: ""Love from *her name* and the rest of the staff, except for *my name*? Thank you, and happy holidays!""

About 5 minutes after I sent the email, she came storming over and told me that I had no right to accuse her of taking credit for the gifts and not including everyone's name. I asked if it was untrue that that's what her card said last year - to which she answered that that's how she's always written the card. Apparently, she's currently scrambling, because a lot of other staff members are choosing not to join her gift this year, and her friend (F60) has told me that it was super petty and ""not very much in the spirit of Christmas of me to ruin the gift to management this year"" while grumbling about how selfish I and other younger staff members are who don't want to contribute to the gift.

So Reddit, am I the asshole in this situation?

Edit to add: Clarification that the minimum sum was $10 per gift, which is $30 in total for each staff-member, sorry if that was unclear (english is not my first language as much as I feel like I’m fluent, haha).

Since “Ann” went vegan we’ve always accommodated her dietary restrictions with at the very least some tofurkey, one side dish and one dessert being strictly vegan.  
  This year Ann jumped in early and for the first time ever said she wanted to cook Thanksgiving this year. Not a problem. Until she informed us in the group chat dinner will be 100% vegan. Some of us offered to bring more omnivore offerings, including a turkey and she insisted we eat vegan while at her house. She declared that vegan food “tastes exactly the same” as omnivore food. It does not. I’ve been to her house and choked down bean burgers and chocolate cake and probably a dozen other meals each of which she insisted tasted just like the real thing. She even tried to fool me once with a beyond burger, insisting is was a regular hamburger. 
  I have only found a limited number of vegan dishes I enjoy and none of them have ever been made by her. 
After thinking it over and discussing it with my husband we decided to privately tell her we were bowing out of dinner on Thanksgiving this year. I told her I wanted turkey, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie that were made with traditional ingredients. 
  I could have lied and said we had plans to travel to see family but I don’t want lie. 
  Ann has become angrier and angrier with me since I told her this about a week ago. Then she went and complained to some of the women in our group about me refusing to attend just because she’s cooking. 

Which is sort of true but still made me angry. So I ended explaining to the other ladies that we all very considerately make vegan dishes just for her at every party and get together any of us throw and it’s really unreasonable for her to insist that I strictly adhere to her dietary choices when I have never demanded the same from her. 

  So that blew up because all the ladies have now jumped to my way of thinking and decided they will have Thanksgiving at one of their houses instead. (We will not be attending their Thanksgiving either)

  My husband says we probably should have lied about going out of town or at the very least I should have not explained my reasoning to the other ladies.

I have an ex with whom I share two kids (13M & 12M). Our relationship did not work out and we broke up seven years ago. Since I was the financially stable one, she wanted me to have full custody. I have had full custody ever since. She has visitation, but she only uses it intermittently. Quickly after the breakup, she started dating a guy “with money.” He is from overseas. She quickly got pregnant by the guy and they had a son. The guy did not want to “raise someone else’s kids,” so she moved three hours away and completely stopped seeing our kids for almost two years. It turns out the guys’ money was actually family money, and when his conservative family found out about my ex and the baby, they cut them off. Also, their son had some developmental issues. She got pregnant again and a few months later, her BF left and returned to his home country. She is now 6-ish months pregnant with no job and taking care of a special needs kid.

She called me last week and asked me for financial help. They are living out of a motel and she is running out of money. I have a lake house about 30 minutes from her. She asked if she could stay there. I said “no.” She asked if I would send her money, I said, “no.” She called me an AH. She said that I am letting “my family” suffer unnecessarily when I have the means to help. I told I have no obligation to help. We have been arguing ever since.

I have one child from a previous relationship, he has two, and we have one together. 

We have always treated the children as equally as possible, though with extended family, they don't always go on the same trips if we don't go. Ex: his parents take his children on vacations and my child doesn't want to go without me. This has never been an issue. But when we plan trips, we always take everyone. 

The problem is that my SD (16 f) doesn't really like anything that anyone else does. Or she will like it until someone else does. Ex: she really wanted to go on a winter trip to Colorado for skiing. None of the other children were that excited, but seeing as it's hard to find things she likes, we went. She was excited until the other kids started enjoying it too, then she wanted to leave. This is pretty much what happens when we went on trips to the zoo, museums, anything. And if other people are already happy about it, she immediately hates the idea.

We thought maybe she just wanted time with each parent alone. So we did that with both her mom and dad. She still complained the whole time. Her counselor said maybe she wants activities with both parents to show they get along. They did that but if they show any enjoyment at all, she hates whatever they are doing. We've done girl days with her mom and I and she hates it. We have found the less enthusiastic we are, the more she wants to do it. 

This applies to meals too. If someone else likes something, she finds ways to criticize it. It's like she can't let anyone else enjoy anything. She also likes things more if no one else wants to do them. This also happens when she goes with her aunt and cousins. Her sister is not like this at all. We've asked her if she has any insight (their mother has too) and she comes up with nothing other than, ""She's just a b***h"" and shrugs. 

We let her choose other day trips, told her she can bring her friend, but it's the same. If she sees someone like something she chose, she complains and says it was her idea like no one else can enjoy it.

So this year, we had been talking about Disney for a while. My nephew has cancer and has always wanted to go with us because he has no siblings and not many friends because he's missed a lot of school. SD said it was stupid as soon as everyone else wanted to go. Her father said he would have a lot of work to catch up on when he got back. He does seasonal work and has to take the work while he can. The kids agreed that they wanted to go and he wanted us to, so I made the plans and we decided to go back another year with all of us. 

I made the reservations for myself, sister, nephew, and 3 of our children, deciding SD can stay back with dad since she didn't want to go anyway.

My husband says ITA for not planning for her to come too but I don't want her ruining the trip with complaints with my nephew there. Aita?

Edit: To clarify, I asked SD multiple times if she wanted to go as I planned, so I would know at each stage if she had changed her mind. She was adamant every time she didn't want to go. Her dad says she always says she doesn't want to go but would regret missing out. This is based on last summer's vacation when she said she didnt want to go but loved it. We were at a campground and it rained the whole time. We were pretty miserable but she thought it was funny.

When he got the invite, we had only been together for a few months, so it was a fresh relationship (they invited him alone). I was working in a COVID ward and managed to get him across the border as a worker in a private car (about an 8-hour journey), and I also got him a PCR test 2 hours before departure (I mention this because the whole arrangement wasn’t easy).

Four years later, we were getting married in chateau (about 4 hours from both my family and his, so halfway) and invited the friend along with his wife and child.

It’s also worth noting that this friend is a teacher and the wedding was on a Saturday, a week before the end of the school year.

A few days before the wedding, they called to say they wouldn’t come because he didn’t get leave for Monday and it wasn’t worth the trip for just a few days. We ended up paying for the room since it was too late to cancel. We didn’t receive a gift or even a congratulatory card from them.

Today, they wrote saying they want to visit because they’re going to an event in our city and would appreciate accommodation for them and his sister. I’m against it because I don’t see a reason to take leave, pick them up from the train station, and host them when I don’t view them as friends anymore (no contact throughout the year, no birthday or name day wishes).

UPDATE1: 
Wow, I didn’t expect so many responses. Most of you advised us to suggest a hotel for them and then meet up for dinner. I’ll suggest this to my husband and let you know how it goes. To clarify a few things:

1.	⁠My husband’s friend wouldn’t have been fired if he decided to come to our wedding; it just would have been more challenging for him because he would have had to travel 4 hours on Saturday (the ceremony was at 4:00 PM, as is customary here, followed by dinner and celebrating until morning) and then travel back around noon on Sunday. He didn’t get leave because it was a week before the end of the school year.
2.	⁠I don’t know his sister, and my husband knows her only briefly, from occasional meetings.
3.	⁠They RSVPed yes, so we paid for and reserved the accommodation, but later called to say they couldn’t come because they didn’t have leave.
4.	⁠Where I’m from, it’s customary to pay for everything for the guests. For example, I’ve noticed that if a bride wants bridesmaids, she typically pays for their dresses and accessories (though good friends often offer to pay for themselves to keep costs down, but it’s not expected). So usually, guests don’t even ask about accommodation; they automatically expect it unless told otherwise. I don’t think this is ideal, as it creates various situations.
5.	⁠I didn’t smuggle him across the border. We were both medical workers ( but me in covid ward), and one of the ways to cross the border was by transporting medical supplies, which happened every Friday. I was responsible for selecting people, and I listed him so he could go that weekend. He had to complete training and paperwork for this. Long story short, it required a lot of arrangements not only on my side but also his side.

UPDATE2:
I followed the advice of the majority of you. I suggested the idea to my husband, and although he was hesitant, he agreed. We called his friend and proposed that we reserve a hotel for them and then go out for dinner together. Unfortunately, we explained that we couldn’t host them at our place because we are busier than we would like, but we would be very happy to see them and even visit them in their area, or welcome them for dinner.

The friend, however, seemed disappointed and hinted that they might not be able to see each other after all since they would have to pay for a hotel and were unsure if they could afford restaurant expenses in our area, as it’s a bit more expensive here. He said we would figure it out closer to the time, but I got the feeling that they might not end up meeting. My husband was a bit disappointed but didn’t say much and doesn’t want to talk about it anymore.

I feel bad that he’s sad about this, but I still believe that he can put his energy into people who truly appreciate how selfless and kind he is. I’m also very grateful for all the responses. Many comments made me see things differently. I will never stop him from seeing his friend; that was never an option. I will update you all when the trip happens.

This upset me so much I had to lock myself in my bedroom to cool off. All is well, as my husband surprised me with a new one for my birthday the month following.

Once they headed back home from my house after Thanksgiving, I decided I needed to take the extra step if my wishes could not be followed. I went on amazon and bought a large glass display case with a lock on the doors, like a trophy case you would see in a school. I neatly arranged the Skylanders, Disney Infinity figures, and Amilbos all on their own shelves. Since it is around Christmas time, my sister has once again come to stay in home with my nephew. It was to his very unpleasant surprise when he entered our game room to see this newly locked display case. He begged me to open it so he can play with the figures and I repeatedly told him about all of the other games he could play.

Jane says l've gone too far purchasing a large display case for my ""toys"" so I can, as she puts it,
""lock up the one thing tommy enjoys playing with when he visits."" She also has our mother on her side, calling me to tell me to stop “bullying my nephew.”

AITA?

EDIT: I do not want to lock the entire game room because my nephew loves to play our nintendo switch and sometimes my husband and I will also play Mario Kart with him. My nephew is very respectful of our nintendo switch and our other games. For some reason it is ONLY the figures that are the issue. I don’t want to leave him bored at my house so I don’t want to lock the entire room.

His kids call my mom names, say she feeds them shit, tell her she's fat and ugly and they gag whenever they know she cooked for everyone. It's gross.

Out of nowhere, my sister made a snarky comment in front of everyone about how “brave” I was for wearing something so “tight.” I was embarrassed, but I didn’t want to make a scene, so I let it slide.

Later that night, she made another comment, this time in private, about how she’d *never* wear something like that unless she lost weight. I got upset and told her that what she said really hurt my feelings, but she brushed it off, saying she was “just being honest.”

Now, I don’t feel like helping her out with the wedding dress anymore. I told her this, and she flipped out, calling me selfish and petty. She says I’m “ruining her big day” over a joke and that it’s not fair for me to back out when I already agreed to help.

I agree it was horrible way to treat a guest and we have already talked to our organization and they are currently looking for a new host family for Sarah. 

My wife is still upset but is starting to feel incredibly guilty and has apologized but I understand that no amount of sorry will make Sarah feel safe again. Tensions are still high but I showed Sarah some of the comments and she finds it hilarious and comforting and I again assured Sarah that she didn’t do anything wrong and dark children’s songs are in every culture and doesent harm anyone. And to answer some other questions no my wife doesent usually do this and she was starting to panic when I talked to her about what she actually said and how Sarah probably feel being trapped in our house in a foreign country. I also showed her the true meaning of the song by one of the comments which caused her to almost have a panic attack that I needed to guide her through.

We will investigate this further since I know some of you had theories about how it could be menopaus so we will look into that.

>1- I am not a client, I am your brother and he is your nephew first off. When you and \[ex-husband\] were considering selling your home I was going to do 1% commission instead of 3% because you’re family, which roughly would have been about and $8,500 pay cut. \[This was never discussed.\]

>2- I did pay hundreds for a daycare, and I have no problem doing it again. The difference is a daycare I know 100% I can always take my son there, with him going to y’all, we have to figure out a solution using leave hours anytime the house is down with sickness or y’all go on vacation.

>3- I am compensating based on the amount of work you have to do for the 3-4 hours he is there, actually hourly it’s more than compensating. It is not my fault you chose a route where you don’t make a lot of money, but that damn sure doesn’t make it my responsibility to make up for it.

>4- I think your mindset is a little twisted. You have the opportunity to see and build a relationship with your nephew and get paid for it separately where we don’t count toward your attendance. That is either $400-$450 a month for seeing your nephew or if you want to be petty it can easily be $0.

>5- y’all are the ones that said over and over again you wanted to see \[nephew\] more often and wished he would go there. I am not by any means strapped for money where I can’t easily put him back in daycare full time… but y’all wanted to watch him and I knew it would bring some extra money your way at the same time so should be a win/win. Where you have it f--ked up is you think I need to take him there and you want to talk like he’s just another kid or I’m just another client. I’m not the one to be getting in a back and forth with. If you want the money every month to see your nephew then you need to check yourself, or I’ll keep him the rest of this week and he will start somewhere else next week, I’m not here to play “you’re hurting my feelings games”.

>Let me know, but this isn’t a back and forth. I thought it was a good way for him to spend time with his family and to put some money in your pocket, if it’s a problem already, just say so and I’ll gladly make other arrangements.

After that, I responded that I thought his message was entitled and disrespectful, and I think it’s best we do not continue a business relationship.

>2- I did pay hundreds for a daycare, and I have no problem doing it again. The difference is a daycare I know 100% I can always take my son there, with him going to y’all, we have to figure out a solution using leave hours anytime the house is down with sickness or y’all go on vacation.

>3- I am compensating based on the amount of work you have to do for the 3-4 hours he is there, actually hourly it’s more than compensating. It is not my fault you chose a route where you don’t make a lot of money, but that damn sure doesn’t make it my responsibility to make up for it.

>4- I think your mindset is a little twisted. You have the opportunity to see and build a relationship with your nephew and get paid for it separately where we don’t count toward your attendance. That is either $400-$450 a month for seeing your nephew or if you want to be petty it can easily be $0.

>5- y’all are the ones that said over and over again you wanted to see \[nephew\] more often and wished he would go there. I am not by any means strapped for money where I can’t easily put him back in daycare full time… but y’all wanted to watch him and I knew it would bring some extra money your way at the same time so should be a win/win. Where you have it f--ked up is you think I need to take him there and you want to talk like he’s just another kid or I’m just another client. I’m not the one to be getting in a back and forth with. If you want the money every month to see your nephew then you need to check yourself, or I’ll keep him the rest of this week and he will start somewhere else next week, I’m not here to play “you’re hurting my feelings games”.

>Let me know, but this isn’t a back and forth. I thought it was a good way for him to spend time with his family and to put some money in your pocket, if it’s a problem already, just say so and I’ll gladly make other arrangements.

After that, I responded that I thought his message was entitled and disrespectful, and I think it’s best we do not continue a business relationship. My brother says I’m “entitled,” my mindset is “twisted,” and I should “say less.” AITA?",False,False,AmItheAsshole,AITA because I won’t give my brother daycare for $25/day?,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cbwyte/aita_because_i_wont_give_my_brother_daycare_for/

And my parents make me feel like they want me to be another adult and not one of their kids.

They don't like me spending time with friends. They say I could be home, helping, taking care of my sisters or doing stuff at home for them. When I do go they can make me take one or both sisters. Get angry if Alisha can't join. If I'm forced to take one of my sisters, or both, I can't have fun. I get stuck making sure they're okay. Even birthday parties (like at places and not kid parties anymore) I can be forced to bring them when they're not invited and I get to watch them have fun. If I have fun at something and my sisters don't, then I get in trouble. Happened during our last field trips. I had a great time, Alisha had to leave early because she was sick, Kayleigh had such a bad time. I told grandpa I had a great time and my parents berated me for it.

My parents get annoyed when I confide in grandpa. But they also get annoyed if I tell them how they make me feel. Alisha hates being left out which I get. But I'm the only one my parents get angry with for it.

Now we're in family therapy. My parents are using it to talk about how awful I am. They say I'm making life harder for everyone. They didn't expect me to say how things really are. But I did.

I said they can't stand me having fun without my sisters or seeing me being the only one having fun, but almost like it when I'm the one not having fun.

We've been there almost 4 years. In that time, we've become good friends with a few other households on our corner of the lake. Some of our group is quite outgoing... always meeting new people in our lake community and being welcoming, us included. Everyone's awesome, but one couple has become problematic.  

Last year we met Roger and Helene, who have a seasonal cottage on a different part of the lake. They're around weekends. They check-in with us/our friend group when in town, or stop by unannounced. This is fine. What's hard is they want to get together all of the time, and don't seem to accept it when we tell them we're busy. They get in their boat, drive over to our area, and anchor straight in front of our properties. It makes everyone uncomfortable. They'll stay there for an hour +. If we're working in the yard, they'll repeatedly go by, telling us to quit working to join them. Other times, when at the campfire, they'll dock their boat at one of our docks, then join us at the fire - without the invitation. They'll also drive or walk over from their place to check up on us, even after being told we're not available.

When we're in our boat they'll drive theirs over and say ""Let's tie up the boats"" - so we can hangout on the water together. Normally, it's fine, except for when we're hosting guests. We've struggled with how to say no. My husband and I would never say ""Let's tie up"" to other boaters. We would swing by, say hello, then see if we're invited. If not, we move along. That's protocol, but it's lost on Roger and Helene. 

Recently, out-of-town friends who have been to the lake a few times declined our invitation to visit, citing that they don't like the visits being interrupted by the neighbors, specifically Roger and Helene. Our core friend group is very respectful about visitors, so we knew who was the issue. Our corner of the lake complains about these two all the time and has struggled with how to handle their constant orbiting. Having a visit invitation turned down because of them made me extra annoyed.  

Soooo, 2 weeks ago we were on our pontoon with friends, when Roger and Helene showed up and said, ""Let's tie up!"" We'd already told them we were busy via text when they checked in. But apparently, they just couldn't resist coming out when they saw us. Being extra annoyed, I finally spoke up, ""Sorry, we're good. We're entertaining. We'll have to get together another time."" 

Later, I got an angry text from Helene. She said I was rude and embarrassed them. I texted back saying I was sorry they felt that way, but they needed to respect when we're busy, and that at times my husband and I felt stalked. Haven't heard from them since. A couple of our core friends say I shouldn't have said anything; that their stalking isn't a big deal, they're nice... This is surprising and upsetting me.

My country does ensure a long maternity leave for up to 2 years, however I am self employed and cannot afford to lose my clients so I try to work while my daughter is sleeping and during the weekends. Lately she's been teething so I'm operating on little to no sleep.  

I have an issue with my MIL. She does what she wants despite people asking her not to and then says 'oops' or denies doing it. Things like that. It was annoying before the baby but after she was born it has become insufferable. Husband talked to her and set boundaries, so she stopped doing that when my husband is present but she was still doing it when it's only me in the room. So we agreed she cannot visit when husband is not at home and husband is not to leave me alone with her.  

Because of these boundaries we did not see them for 1.5months. They live 2hr away and we did not find a mutually good time. They finally came over last Sunday.  

20min into the visit my FIL wants to see a lawnmower that has broken down so my husband goes into the backyard with him, leaving me, the baby and MIL inside. She's drinking coffee and eating cake. She sits next to my daughter on her playmat and tries to feed her some of her cake. I immediately told her no, she can't have that. MIL pretends not to hear me and proceeds putting her spoon to my daughter's closed mouth. I repeat stop doing that, she can't have cake yet and definitely not from your spoon. Still she pretends not to hear me. I repeat it again, still nothing and now there's cake on my baby's face and she's fussing. So I grab my daughter and go to my husband and FIL, subtly gesturing him to come back inside.  

After about 5mins MIL decided to go outside too and was approaching me and the baby. I gestured to my husband again and he made an annoyed face. I had no energy to deal with any of this so I stood up, went inside, grabbed baby bag and car keys and went to the car without saying a word. MIL asked me where I was going and I ignored her.  

I drove to my sister's, which is about 15min drive. There were some missed calls from my husband so I texted him where we were and that we'll be back in the evening. It was time for my daughters nap and she fell asleep breastfeeding so my sister told me to go sleep too. After she woke up and had her milk my sister took her and told me to go back to sleep. I slept ~3hrs in total and my phone was on silent so my husbands calls were ignored and apparently his parents left disappointed and MiL cried.  

My husband is furious I did this. We're still fighting about it. He can't believe I was so rude and took the baby away when his parents came to see her after such a long time. He's angry I couldn't have waited a few minutes so that he could finish talking about the lawnmower. I told him I'm too exhausted to deal with this shit. He left me alone with MIL despite our agreement (be it only 10mins) so I left. AITA?

I have an issue with my MIL. She does what she wants despite people asking her not to and then says 'oops' or denies doing it. Things like that. It was annoying before the baby but after she was born it has become insufferable. Husband talked to her and set boundaries, so she stopped doing that when my husband is present but she was still doing it when it's only me in the room. So we agreed she cannot visit when husband is not at home and husband is not to leave me alone with her.  

Because of these boundaries we did not see them for 1.5months. They live 2hr away and we did not find a mutually good time. They finally came over last Sunday.  

20min into the visit my FIL wants to see a lawnmower that has broken down so my husband goes into the backyard with him, leaving me, the baby and MIL inside. She's drinking coffee and eating cake. She sits next to my daughter on her playmat and tries to feed her some of her cake. I immediately told her no, she can't have that. MIL pretends not to hear me and proceeds putting her spoon to my daughter's closed mouth. I repeat stop doing that, she can't have cake yet and definitely not from your spoon. Still she pretends not to hear me. I repeat it again, still nothing and now there's cake on my baby's face and she's fussing. So I grab my daughter and go to my husband and FIL, subtly gesturing him to come back inside.  

After about 5mins MIL decided to go outside too and was approaching me and the baby. I gestured to my husband again and he made an annoyed face. I had no energy to deal with any of this so I stood up, went inside, grabbed baby bag and car keys and went to the car without saying a word. MIL asked me where I was going and I ignored her.  

I drove to my sister's, which is about 15min drive. There were some missed calls from my husband so I texted him where we were and that we'll be back in the evening. It was time for my daughters nap and she fell asleep breastfeeding so my sister told me to go sleep too. After she woke up and had her milk my sister took her and told me to go back to sleep. I slept ~3hrs in total and my phone was on silent so my husbands calls were ignored and apparently his parents left disappointed and MiL cried.  

My husband is furious I did this. We're still fighting about it. He can't believe I was so rude and took the baby away when his parents came to see her after such a long time. He's angry I couldn't have waited a few minutes so that he could finish talking about the lawnmower. I told him I'm too exhausted to deal with this shit. He left me alone with MIL despite our agreement (be it only 10mins) so I left. AITA?

It was sent to my parents in an email that I will be giving a speech that day as my grades made me valedictorian of my school's class of 2024, and I was excited to do so. My school made us reserve and buy tickets to the ceremony weeks in advance, and I picked mine up on the 26th. 

The problem started at dinner when I told my family I picked up the tickets for my graduation day and would keep them with me until the day of just to make sure they don't get lost. My dad told me that he and my sister had plans for an hour before the ceremony, but that my mom would be there the whole time, and that they'd try to be there for the afterparty. I was honestly shocked for a moment, before starting to laugh, assuming they weren't serious. 

When I realized they actually weren't joking, I'll admit I was a bit mad. I'm usually a very shy and non-confrontational person, even around my family, but I started yelling at my dad and sister, asking if they were seriously ditching my graduation ceremony. I told them that the afterparty was useless to attend, and that all the pictures of the graduates with their families would be taken at least 2 hours before the ceremony. They said it's fine and we can take our own pictures the day after my graduation, but I got up and left dinner. 

Over the weekend, I saw a few people on my class group chat complain that they didn't get enough tickets, so I offered up the two tickets I had, and met up with a girl from my class to give them to her, and even though I told her not to, she actually paid me the original price for them. 

When the topic of graduation was brought up by my dad today during lunch, I told him that I gave the other two tickets away and only my mom will be attending, so they shouldn't bother with the afterparty. He got mad and asked why I would do that, to which I replied that I don't see the point in wasting money on tickets if they're not going to use them. My dad blew up on me, saying I'm acting like a spoiled brat, and it's not like I'll die if he and my sister are a bit late to my graduation. 

I spoke to a few people about it, my friends and my grandma. My friends said good riddance and if they consider their plans more important, they can have fun. But my grandma said that while she understands my side, I shouldn't have given away the tickets just to spite my dad, because maybe he would have changed his mind and gone on time. So I'm looking for a non-biased opinion. AITA?

Edit for info: the plans my dad and sister have is some sleepover with her and her friend group in the north, around a 2 hour drive from where we live. The parents didn’t want to leave a bunch of under 16 year old girls alone that far, so everyone’s parents are also going for supervision (apart from my mom who is going to be at my graduation)

I 42F got married 24 years ago. I decided that if I had a daughter, I would pass the dress and accessories on to her. I chose a simple, elegant dress, rather than what was fashionable at the time, because I wanted something timeless that people could wear for generations to come. I had my son “Mark” now 22M a year after, and his father passed away when he was young. I raised Mark as a single mom for several years. I decided that when Mark married, I would give my dress and accessories to his wife.

When I was 33, I met “Rob” now 52M. I fell in love with him and we quickly married. He became a great father figure for Mark, and I was so excited to have a stepdaughter, “Molly” now 24F. My relationship with Molly had a rocky beginning. I’ve been patient and gentle with her. I’ve offered to take her shopping or get her nails done. I asked Rob about her favorite foods and made sure to cook those. She made it clear that she didn’t see me as her real mom.

Years passed, and I never changed the way I treated Molly. My door was always open for her, but she never changed the way she thought about me. She called me a trophy wife to my face. If I ever threw a charity event, she would remark “Wow, you’re so generous with dad’s money.” While she didn’t say anything explicitly, I could tell she looked down on me for not having a college degree.

A couple years ago, I made a final offering to Molly. I brought her into my closet and showed her the dress and accessories and told her I would love for her to wear them at her wedding. Some alterations would have to be done (I am 5’9 and a size 4, while Molly is 5’4 and a size 8), but we could make it work. Molly scoffed and said I had archaic values and that the dress was trashy, and walked out. That really hurt because she knew what that dress meant to me and she didn’t care. After that, I stopped making as much of an effort to build a relationship with her.

Two months ago, Mark proposed to his college sweetheart “Lucy,” with whom I have a great relationship. When Lucy mentioned dress shopping, I showed her my dress. Lucy tried it on and it fit like a glove. She fell in love with it, and I told her the dress, shoes, and accessories were hers. She was so happy she literally cried.

However, a couple days ago, Molly reached out to me out of the blue to ask if the dress was still available. I told her I had given it to Lucy. She asked if I could get it back from Lucy, since I offered it to her first, and I told her 1) she said she didn’t want it, 2) it fits Lucy perfectly, and 3) Lucy is the only one getting married within the foreseeable future.

Now Molly is saying I’m favoring Lucy over her because she’s conforming to traditional standards of femininity (getting married and being thin). That’s absolute baloney, but it got me thinking that if the roles were reversed and Lucy was the one asking for the dress after initially turning it down, would I give it to her? Is Molly right that I’m favoring Lucy? AITA?

UPDATE

Wow, thank you for all of your kind words! I wanted to give an update to respond to general questions and comments. First, I want to say that the fact that most of the comments are “NTA” is very reassuring. It makes me feel better about my decision to not give my dress to Molly.

I saw some comments suggesting this, so I would like to let you know I already gave the dress to Lucy and it’s safe in her apartment now. Molly has already been bugging Lucy about the dress, but Lucy told me there’s “no way in heck” she’s giving it away. Some of you have also been wondering about Mark and Rob’s responses. Mark is currently out of town on business and I have had no communication with him on this matter. I’m sure he’ll be supportive of Lucy though. I did not bring this up to Rob, because while Molly and I have a difficult relationship, I don’t want to sow division between her and her father. However, Rob brought it up last night, saying Molly had contacted him on the matter. Rob was like, “You aren’t going to give it to her, are you?” When I said no, he told me to promise him I would not give the dress to her. It was very comforting to know Rob is on my side.

Another thing I want to get clear, I do NOT expect Molly to conform to certain “standards.” When I referred to “traditional standards of femininity (getting married and being thin)”, I was paraphrasing words that came out of her mouth. I was raised in a traditional household, but I understand that a lot of women, especially young women, do not share my values. Frankly Lucy doesn’t either. She has an engineering degree and openly talks about wanting to prioritize her career over starting a family, at least for the foreseeable future, and I couldn’t be happier for her. I DO realize that I could have done a better job communicating to Molly that I don’t care what she does so long as she is a good person and she leaves the world better than she found it.

Lastly, because after reading the comments I fear I painted Molly in a bad light, I should say that Molly has had a rough life due to the divorce between Bob and her biological mother. I have never met her mother, and I don’t want to go into gross detail on the internet about someone’s life other than my own, but I will say that her relationship with her mother is not great. I think Molly might be projecting aspects of that relationship onto me. However, your comments have helped me realize she is in the wrong in this situation. I’ve also realized that it isn’t just on me to build a relationship with her–she has to work at it too, and so far she has not. I’m never going to shut her out, but at this point if she wants to connect with me, SHE has to be the one making the effort. I really hope the best for her, but she sure as heck isn’t getting that dress.","AITA for giving my wedding dress to my future daughter-in-law instead of my stepdaughter?w/ update!!

I (35f) have 2 kids (17 m/f twins) and 1 stepdaughter (18) who I met when she was 11. 

The other day, I was at my parents house going over some estate planning as I am the executor. While reviewing, I saw my folks had split their assets to be half for my 2 siblings and I and the other half for their grandkids—all to be distributed evenly. My stepdaughter was included. When I asked them about this, they said they wanted to be fair. Their estate isn’t super large, but the sum would be substantial (think new car). 

I told my parents that while generous of them, I didn’t think it would be necessary and would be better to split between their 5 grandkids. 

When we got home, my husband said he overheard what I said and that I was being an AH for alienating his daughter. 

I told him my reasoning was because she is the only child/grandchild/niece on both her parent’s sides and that she would be set. Her grandparents own multiple properties, her uncles are fairly well off and live in a HCOL area, and well, she’s the only kid and it’s not looking like (at least in his side) that she’ll have any cousins. Plus, their collective net worth is substantially more than my side. I also asked him if his parents included my kids in their estate, but he refused to answer. 

Still. He said I was being an AH and accused me of not caring about her future. I think I was doing the right thing by looking out for my kids and their cousins. AITA? 

Edit: I was told to include this in the post-

1- I didn’t argue with or pressure my parents to make a change. I simply mentioned that I don’t feel it was necessary for her to receive a monetary amount. 

2- my mom plans on giving her a set of family heirloom jewelry that is her birthstone. I think this is quite thoughtful. I’m not a big jewelry person and she has other sets for the other girls in the family so I feel this is ok. 

3- my parents have seen her about 3-5x a year since I met her.

4- my nephews and my kids do not have active relationships with their biological father sides. My niece is a new mom and works at a restaurant. I feel that financial inheritance would be more impactful for them even as such a small amount. 

5- I know my SD is set to inherit at least 2 houses in a major us city with HCOL.  I found this out a while back after my husband asked me to help him organize his office. I had to read through papers to know how to file them accordingly. The paper was a certified copy and was drafted soon after we married. My kids were not included. I am not sure if it has been updated. I did not ask him about it at the time because I did not have an issue with it. 

6- There is distance in the relationship but I don’t feel it’s my fault. I can explain this. When I met her mom for the first time, she made it very clear that I wasn’t her mom. I didn’t see this as an issue because I did not want to overstep and as a mom myself, I could see where she was coming from and respected her request. 

But as time progressed, our opportunity to spend time together became less frequent. At first my husband had every other weekend visitation. It became less frequent as she became a teenager because she wanted to spend the night with friends, hang out, etc which I see as normal teenager behavior. The other piece is that we were never invited to be included in major celebrations for her. We usually celebrated birthdays with her a week after because we weren’t invited (my husband was-just not us). She’s also never spent Thanksgiving or Christmas with us because her mom wanted those days. Again, which I saw as fine because that’s her only child. My husband would spend holidays with her at her mom’s house which I encouraged because I knew the importance of father/daughter connections. We also were not invited to her HS graduation. 

I think she’s a beautiful and brilliant young woman and care for her tremendously. But It’s challenging to develop deep meaningful relationships with people you have little contact with.

7- for people putting me in the category of the evil stepmother, saying that I see her as other, don’t think that I haven’t been trying since the beginning. I include her in every way I can in the times that she is with us by doing things like teaching her my family recipes, taking her shopping for clothes so that she doesn’t have to bring things back-and-forth, and attending every school athletic event that I could. 

I have tried to include her in family vacation planning, but was told by her mother that unless the vacation occurred on a weekend we’re scheduled to have with her then she would not allow us to have the time. This limited our options to local weekend trips but even then, her mom comes up with some reason she can’t join—including surprise trips to another state. I even suggested a family cruise in lieu of a honeymoon to celebrate our new family but was blocked by her mom. My husband is allowed to take her on extended vacations as long as it’s just the two of them.  

I have tried to be flexible in accommodations around holidays by postponing things like Christmas morning so that she can be included. This created frustration in my kids because they felt like they shouldn’t have to put their lives aside to accommodate for her. One year when the holiday occurred on one of our planned weekends, I came up with the suggestion of celebrating Christmas on Christmas Eve so we could do the full family thing. My kids weren’t thrilled, but they understood. In the end we didn’t end up spending any time with her as her mom told us that she planned on having a dinner party on Christmas Eve and needed my stepdaughter to help her prepare. 

When the time came for college applications, I was ecstatic to be asked by my stepdaughter to help her with the applications, but soon after was told that her mom hired a professional to help her get into her top choice schools and I was no longer needed. 

I have tried to have a bond with her with the little time that I have. I have consistently brought up to my husband that I feel like we needed more time with her to help build our relationship at the very least by him maintaining his every other weekend schedule. He has told me that ultimately her mom is her mom and she determines her schedule and how she spends her time. He has also expressed that he fears that if he undermines her mom, then he might lose the time and relationship that he does have with her and I do not want to be the reason for any sort of break in their relationship. His time/relationship with her hasn’t changed, so maybe he doesn’t see the need for me/my kids to be involved. But If he doesn’t advocate for us, then what am I supposed to do? 


**** Major update ****

I haven’t had the opportunity to have a discussion with my husband about all of this, as I was waiting to speak with my therapist to get advice on the best way to approach the conversation. 

However, I did receive a phone call this morning from my father-in-law who I see as an absolute angel of a man. Apparently, my husband told his mom about our argument and my mother-in-law went off and this is how my father-in-law found out about it. FIL asked me what my side of the story was and I very emotionally told him everything as I listed in the OP. I told him it was not my intention to alienate SD in anyway and that this whole thing has created a nightmare.

After deep breath and slight pause, my FIL said that I did the right thing. A few years ago, my FIL suffered a series of strokes. He said that this prompted him to want to reevaluate the estate to make sure that everything was in order. He is quite old (close to 90) and has a lot of underlying health issues. He and my MIL share all of their assets and she is also his POA in case anything happens, and because they have a family trust, he wanted to include her and his sons in the discussion. 

He told me that he brought up that he wanted to include my children in the family trust. He told me he proposed to allow for 10% of the trusts liquid assets to be split between my two kids to help get a start on life. He then said that my MIL pushed back very hard saying that because my children were not biologically related to their family and they should not be considered. When he asked my husband his thoughts on it, FIL said my husbands response was that it was best to “keep it in the family” but that he would “consider” including us in his portion upon his passing if he and I were still together. FIL said this was a surprise because at that point we were still basically newlyweds and was surprised a new husband would even think that way. My MILs response to that was unhappy saying again we weren’t blood and that this was a family issue. Because of the stress caused by the situation, and because of the recent strokes, FIL did not want to press things further. 

FIL said afterwards, he pulled my husband aside to find out more about what he had meant and to be assured that my kids would be included and was basically told by my husband that he would do what was “best for his family” and the conversation was dropped. 

Now, FIL said that he didn’t push further at this point because he was getting tired from the conversation. But in light of what’s happening and how my MIL and husband are responding behind closed doors, he felt it was necessary to let me know. 

He said that SD is set to be more than ok when it comes time, and that my husband has asked to tap into funds to pay for her college so she would not need to take out any loans, which he agreed to. He said he asked my husband if he would do the same for my kids and that my husbands response was that he would ask when the time came as my kids did not yet know what was going to happen regarding college admissions.  

FIL asked me if my husband and I had this conversation. I told him that my husband and I discussions about my kids school was that they would need to take out loans, finish college, and then we would help pay off half of the loans together once they graduated. My husband has NEVER suggested that anything for my kids college would be paid for through his family trust. 

My FIL was very apologetic, saying he should have pushed further as he loves us greatly and feels like he did not do enough. I told him it was not his fault and that he should not feel responsible for any of this, and that I did not want him to feel obligated to make any changes or bring it up with MIL/husband because I knew it would create additional stress for him and I wanted him to take care of his peace. 

He said though his desire would be to do so, that since his wife and he have a joint estate, and that she is POA, that he felt like it would be more trouble than it’s worth. He is blind and has a lot of mobility issues so anything he does he is dependent on her. He also said that based on what he’s heard on his side, he felt if he did update his will, then they would likely contest it which would create a financial burden on my end and he didn’t want to create a negative situation. 

I told him again that it was ok and that we would be ok in life and that he was not responsible for anything that happened. I told him that my intention wasn’t to be added to the trust, just to make a point to my husband to which he said he understood and agreed. He apologized again, we told each other how much we loved one another and he ended the call saying he considered me a “person of integrity which is a rare gem.”

Now that I have this information, I feel like this whole situation brought to light a lot of things I hadn’t considered regarding my marriage. Also, writing out everything regarding how my husband navigated his relationship with his daughter/ex wife really put things into perspective that makes me feel like we were never a priority for him. 

I’m not sure where to go from here. I plan to bring this all up with my therapist and talk it out to figure out what I should do. But I no longer feel like the AH for advocating for my biological family because my husband and his side have been advocating for theirs (FIL excluded). 

**** Final Update-

I’ve had many people reach out for an update so here it is … I will be divorcing my husband. 

A lot has happened since I posted this. Thank you to those who responded and PM’d me kind words of encouragement that helped me take a step back and evaluate the dynamics of my marriage. 

This whole situation was much bigger than my comment to my parents. And despite everything, I am thankful it was a catalyst for truth rather than wasting more years of my life, love, and energy. 

First, I did try to speak to my husband. Whenever I brought it up he said that he was over the issue. I mentioned to him that I thought it would be good for us to attend couples counseling to work out our differences with a neutral party to help us build a stronger relationship. He agreed and I honored his requests for the type of counselor he wanted to see. However, when the appointment times came, he no-showed citing that things came up at work or he wasn’t feeling up to it. He missed a total of 3 appointments that I ended up attending myself. The counselor helped me recognize some potential covert narcissist traits based on my version of things. The counselor said they couldn’t say for sure these things were true nor could they provide a diagnosis, but from what I said and husbands no shows, they felt it was highly likely. 

The frustration caused by all of this made me decide to take my kids to see my brother and his family for Halloween and the weekend. They live close to a city that goes all out for the holiday and it’s within a reasonable driving distance. My husband didn’t object. I asked him if he had plans and he said he was just going to work around the house and relax. He assumed that I would be with them the whole time. I took my twins, spent the night, and left them there hoping to be able to go home and have a serious conversation with my husband without distractions. On the way home, my daughter called me. She said that there was a post-Halloween party happening at our house and that both SD and her mom were there. She found out because one of her teammates from school’s older sister had been invited. The sister is friends with SD. She also sent me screen shots from social media from the inside of our home where I could see who was in attendance. I didn’t recognize anyone except Husband, SD, and SDs mom. When I got home Friday evening, I pulled up to the house and it was filled with cars including SDs mom. I didn’t knock because I was already embarrassed as it is. Instead, I went to stay with a friend. 

The next morning, I went home to confront my husband. All the cars were gone except SDs mom. A woman who refused to knock on our door during pick-ups/drop-offs had spent the night at our home. 

When I let myself in, all 3 were eating breakfast around the table like a family. SDs mom gave me a big smile and exaggerated hospitality. SD tried hard to hide her giggles. Husband was bewildered. There was no evidence of a major party.  SDs mom said she’d see him later and left with SD. SD did not acknowledge me besides her laughing which continued on her way out of the door. I’m not a confrontational person by nature so I didn’t stop them to question. I asked him to explain. He tried to say that they had just come over for breakfast. I told him I knew that wasn’t the case because I drove by last night. He kept denying but I pressed. I didn’t tell him about the social media.

He tried to gaslight me saying that I lied to him about being gone all weekend. I told him I was taking the kids to see my brother for the weekend but didn’t say I’d be staying with them. I brought up that he lied to me about working around the house. He said the party was a last min request from SDs mom to host for her friends. All of the guests were HER friends. And the amount of guests suggests it was likely planned the moment I mentioned I’d be going out of town. I questioned about her spending the night but he said she slept in the guest bed because she was too drunk to drive but I doubt it. 

I asked him if he even wanted to be married. He said yes. But that his priority is his daughter—who is now in college. I asked what that had to do with her mom and having parties in the home we share—especially now that she is a legal adult. He said that he will “always love her as the mother of his child.”  We agreed early in our relationship that we wouldn’t have kids as we’d essentially be starting over, so this statement hurt me on so many levels. 

I told him that his lies and mistreatment of me was over. That he never prioritized our marriage and always put his “first family” before us. He said I was delusional. I told him not to be home when I came back to get my stuff. 

I called my kids to tell them what happened. They said they weren’t surprised. Apparently, they’ve been feeling some type of was towards him for a while and felt they couldn’t tell me because they knew how important marriage was to me (my parents were an example of what I wanted to have in my own life). I felt like shit for creating that kind of break with my kids. They were gracious and told me I deserved better. I told them they could come home or stay with my brother and they decided to stay. But yes … I am the AH for prioritizing my marriage over my kids.  And I will be setting up family therapy for us. 

I went and rented a 3 bedroom apartment the same day. The friend I stayed with the night before helped me pack my stuff and move over the weekend. Future ex husbands whereabouts were unknown but I can assume…

During the move I got a string of nasty texts from SDs mom saying that I was jealous that she had picked a good man who she conceived a baby with love with—a direct jab at the circumstances under which I had my kids (their dad is an addict and not in the picture). She said I’d never have what they have. 

My understanding of the circumstances of their divorce was that she had an affair. When we first met I explicitly asked if she was ok with me and him dating (at that time). She said she had no issue, and that she was glad he was happy (this was the same day as her comment about me never being ""mom"" to step daughter).  She was also dating someone at the time. 

Once I got settled, I told my family about what happened (parents and siblings). They were livid. Especially my dad. This is where he voiced that he had been sick of trying to include my husband/SD in family events just to be constantly stonewalled by them. They don’t take blatant cruelty lightly and her reaction to my walking in on their breakfast makes them see her as cruel. They said if she had shown even a bit of embarrassment or remorse, they would’ve thought differently of her. 

So yes… I’m the asshole for overlooking my future ex’s treatment of me and my family. For delusionally thinking things would get better. For pouring into people who don’t seem to GAF while I had love and support from my real family. 

I will say, I don’t blame my SD for this. She is her parent’s child. Who knows what was said about me behind closed doors over the years. In that case, she is innocent. However, she is now an adult that can make her own choices. She can decide if she wants to participate in behavior that puts other people down. Maybe she’s still young enough to be influenced under her parent’s thumb regarding how she treats people. Maybe one day she will realize that she can speak up when she sees bullying behavior by members of her own family. But I won’t be around to find out. 

I still talk to my FIL. He’s been checking in on me regularly while MIL is out running errands. He’s sorry for the circumstances but glad I stood up for myself. He told me he will help me in any way he can to make my transition easier. I said the best he can do for me is still be my friend. Now he tells me stories about his younger years instead of us talking about other parties involved. 

My kids like our new place. They said school is still doing ok and are looking forward to graduating. We decided to adopt a cat. Something we all wanted but put off because ex hates them. Both have decided to pursue complementing trades and going into business together after college. They said they had been discussing it for a while. They had mentioned it to me before alongside a long list of other possible post-graduation plans so I was aware of it as a possibility, but now they say it’s the goal. 

I also told my parents that if they wanted to reconsider their will, then I wanted them to decide to do something that made them happy—even if it included SD. They said they had already been talking to a financial advisor after speaking with my brother since the time of our meeting mentioned in the original post. He encouraged them to enjoy their money now. They want to move to my paternal grandparents home country where we have some extended family. Moving will save them a lot of money as the COL is much lower and he can buy land since my dad is a dual citizen. They said if it works out, they’ll leave their house here for my sister and her boys to live in rent free as long as she keeps up maintenance. They also mentioned the possibility of contributing to my niece going back to school so she doesn’t have to work as a server much longer. All this planning on their end started just before the Halloween fall out. I told them I’m glad they’re deciding to enjoy their money while they’re still around. 

Husband has reached out several times begging me to reconcile, asking for marriage counseling, etc. I guess he thought I wasn’t as serious as I was. Said he made a big mistake and put the blame on SDs mom/his mom for “poisoning” him regarding our marriage. Told him it was not my problem and that I hope he has the life he deserves. 

If I could tell my younger self something it would be don’t ignore the red flags. If things feel off or unfair, then they probably are. Don’t prioritize people who couldn’t care less about your feelings or overall wellbeing. People can change, but it’s not your responsibility to help them. Invest that energy in yourself. I’m SO GLAD I kept my job/income despite my husband’s request for me to be a housewife. If I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have been able to leave as quickly as I did. 

TLDR - told my parents I thought it wasn’t necessary to include SD in their will because she’s set to inherit a lot from my husband’s family.  Husband got pissed and said I was alienating his daughter. Later got a call from my FIL saying I wasn’t the AH. Now I’m leaving my husband. ","AITA for telling my parents to not include my stepdaughter in their will?Throw away account …

I (35f) have 2 kids (17 m/f twins) and 1 stepdaughter (18) who I met when she was 11.

**** Major update ****

I haven’t had the opportunity to have a discussion with my husband about all of this, as I was waiting to speak with my therapist to get advice on the best way to approach the conversation. 

However, I did receive a phone call this morning from my father-in-law who I see as an absolute angel of a man.

He said though his desire would be to do so, that since his wife and he have a joint estate, and that she is POA, that he felt like it would be more trouble than it’s worth. He is blind and has a lot of mobility issues so anything he does he is dependent on her. He also said that based on what he’s heard on his side, he felt if he did update his will, then they would likely contest it which would create a financial burden on my end and he didn’t want to create a negative situation. 

I told him again that it was ok and that we would be ok in life and that he was not responsible for anything that happened. I told him that my intention wasn’t to be added to the trust, just to make a point to my husband to which he said he understood and agreed. He apologized again, we told each other how much we loved one another and he ended the call saying he considered me a “person of integrity which is a rare gem.”

Now that I have this information, I feel like this whole situation brought to light a lot of things I hadn’t considered regarding my marriage. Also, writing out everything regarding how my husband navigated his relationship with his daughter/ex wife really put things into perspective that makes me feel like we were never a priority for him. 

I’m not sure where to go from here. I plan to bring this all up with my therapist and talk it out to figure out what I should do. But I no longer feel like the AH for advocating for my biological family because my husband and his side have been advocating for theirs (FIL excluded). 

**** Final Update-

I’ve had many people reach out for an update so here it is … I will be divorcing my husband. 

A lot has happened since I posted this. Thank you to those who responded and PM’d me kind words of encouragement that helped me take a step back and evaluate the dynamics of my marriage. 

This whole situation was much bigger than my comment to my parents. And despite everything, I am thankful it was a catalyst for truth rather than wasting more years of my life, love, and energy. 

First, I did try to speak to my husband. Whenever I brought it up he said that he was over the issue. I mentioned to him that I thought it would be good for us to attend couples counseling to work out our differences with a neutral party to help us build a stronger relationship. He agreed and I honored his requests for the type of counselor he wanted to see. However, when the appointment times came, he no-showed citing that things came up at work or he wasn’t feeling up to it. He missed a total of 3 appointments that I ended up attending myself. The counselor helped me recognize some potential covert narcissist traits based on my version of things. The counselor said they couldn’t say for sure these things were true nor could they provide a diagnosis, but from what I said and husbands no shows, they felt it was highly likely. 

The frustration caused by all of this made me decide to take my kids to see my brother and his family for Halloween and the weekend. They live close to a city that goes all out for the holiday and it’s within a reasonable driving distance. My husband didn’t object. I asked him if he had plans and he said he was just going to work around the house and relax. He assumed that I would be with them the whole time. I took my twins, spent the night, and left them there hoping to be able to go home and have a serious conversation with my husband without distractions. On the way home, my daughter called me. She said that there was a post-Halloween party happening at our house and that both SD and her mom were there. She found out because one of her teammates from school’s older sister had been invited. The sister is friends with SD. She also sent me screen shots from social media from the inside of our home where I could see who was in attendance. I didn’t recognize anyone except Husband, SD, and SDs mom. When I got home Friday evening, I pulled up to the house and it was filled with cars including SDs mom. I didn’t knock because I was already embarrassed as it is. Instead, I went to stay with a friend. 

The next morning, I went home to confront my husband. All the cars were gone except SDs mom. A woman who refused to knock on our door during pick-ups/drop-offs had spent the night at our home. 

When I let myself in, all 3 were eating breakfast around the table like a family. SDs mom gave me a big smile and exaggerated hospitality. SD tried hard to hide her giggles. Husband was bewildered. There was no evidence of a major party.  SDs mom said she’d see him later and left with SD. SD did not acknowledge me besides her laughing which continued on her way out of the door. I’m not a confrontational person by nature so I didn’t stop them to question. I asked him to explain. He tried to say that they had just come over for breakfast. I told him I knew that wasn’t the case because I drove by last night. He kept denying but I pressed. I didn’t tell him about the social media.

He tried to gaslight me saying that I lied to him about being gone all weekend. I told him I was taking the kids to see my brother for the weekend but didn’t say I’d be staying with them. I brought up that he lied to me about working around the house. He said the party was a last min request from SDs mom to host for her friends. All of the guests were HER friends. And the amount of guests suggests it was likely planned the moment I mentioned I’d be going out of town. I questioned about her spending the night but he said she slept in the guest bed because she was too drunk to drive but I doubt it. 

I asked him if he even wanted to be married. He said yes. But that his priority is his daughter—who is now in college. I asked what that had to do with her mom and having parties in the home we share—especially now that she is a legal adult. He said that he will “always love her as the mother of his child.”  We agreed early in our relationship that we wouldn’t have kids as we’d essentially be starting over, so this statement hurt me on so many levels. 

I told him that his lies and mistreatment of me was over. That he never prioritized our marriage and always put his “first family” before us. He said I was delusional. I told him not to be home when I came back to get my stuff. 

I called my kids to tell them what happened. They said they weren’t surprised. Apparently, they’ve been feeling some type of was towards him for a while and felt they couldn’t tell me because they knew how important marriage was to me (my parents were an example of what I wanted to have in my own life). I felt like shit for creating that kind of break with my kids. They were gracious and told me I deserved better. I told them they could come home or stay with my brother and they decided to stay. But yes … I am the AH for prioritizing my marriage over my kids.  And I will be setting up family therapy for us. 

I went and rented a 3 bedroom apartment the same day. The friend I stayed with the night before helped me pack my stuff and move over the weekend. Future ex husbands whereabouts were unknown but I can assume…

During the move I got a string of nasty texts from SDs mom saying that I was jealous that she had picked a good man who she conceived a baby with love with—a direct jab at the circumstances under which I had my kids (their dad is an addict and not in the picture). She said I’d never have what they have. 

My understanding of the circumstances of their divorce was that she had an affair. When we first met I explicitly asked if she was ok with me and him dating (at that time). She said she had no issue, and that she was glad he was happy (this was the same day as her comment about me never being ""mom"" to step daughter).  She was also dating someone at the time. 

Once I got settled, I told my family about what happened (parents and siblings). They were livid. Especially my dad. This is where he voiced that he had been sick of trying to include my husband/SD in family events just to be constantly stonewalled by them. They don’t take blatant cruelty lightly and her reaction to my walking in on their breakfast makes them see her as cruel. They said if she had shown even a bit of embarrassment or remorse, they would’ve thought differently of her. 

So yes… I’m the asshole for overlooking my future ex’s treatment of me and my family. For delusionally thinking things would get better. For pouring into people who don’t seem to GAF while I had love and support from my real family. 

I will say, I don’t blame my SD for this. She is her parent’s child. Who knows what was said about me behind closed doors over the years. In that case, she is innocent. However, she is now an adult that can make her own choices. She can decide if she wants to participate in behavior that puts other people down. Maybe she’s still young enough to be influenced under her parent’s thumb regarding how she treats people. Maybe one day she will realize that she can speak up when she sees bullying behavior by members of her own family. But I won’t be around to find out. 

I still talk to my FIL. He’s been checking in on me regularly while MIL is out running errands. He’s sorry for the circumstances but glad I stood up for myself. He told me he will help me in any way he can to make my transition easier. I said the best he can do for me is still be my friend. Now he tells me stories about his younger years instead of us talking about other parties involved. 

My kids like our new place. They said school is still doing ok and are looking forward to graduating. We decided to adopt a cat. Something we all wanted but put off because ex hates them. Both have decided to pursue complementing trades and going into business together after college. They said they had been discussing it for a while. They had mentioned it to me before alongside a long list of other possible post-graduation plans so I was aware of it as a possibility, but now they say it’s the goal. 

I also told my parents that if they wanted to reconsider their will, then I wanted them to decide to do something that made them happy—even if it included SD. They said they had already been talking to a financial advisor after speaking with my brother since the time of our meeting mentioned in the original post. He encouraged them to enjoy their money now. They want to move to my paternal grandparents home country where we have some extended family. Moving will save them a lot of money as the COL is much lower and he can buy land since my dad is a dual citizen. They said if it works out, they’ll leave their house here for my sister and her boys to live in rent free as long as she keeps up maintenance. They also mentioned the possibility of contributing to my niece going back to school so she doesn’t have to work as a server much longer. All this planning on their end started just before the Halloween fall out. I told them I’m glad they’re deciding to enjoy their money while they’re still around. 

Husband has reached out several times begging me to reconcile, asking for marriage counseling, etc. I guess he thought I wasn’t as serious as I was. Said he made a big mistake and put the blame on SDs mom/his mom for “poisoning” him regarding our marriage. Told him it was not my problem and that I hope he has the life he deserves. 

If I could tell my younger self something it would be don’t ignore the red flags. If things feel off or unfair, then they probably are. Don’t prioritize people who couldn’t care less about your feelings or overall wellbeing. People can change, but it’s not your responsibility to help them. Invest that energy in yourself. I’m SO GLAD I kept my job/income despite my husband’s request for me to be a housewife. If I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have been able to leave as quickly as I did. 

TLDR - told my parents I thought it wasn’t necessary to include SD in their will because she’s set to inherit a lot from my husband’s family.  Husband got pissed and said I was alienating his daughter. Later got a call from my FIL saying I wasn’t the AH. Now I’m leaving my husband.

Sadly, the trip was canceled after our grandpa passed away, and my brother was devastated for both reasons.

To cheer him up, I decided to craft a 'souvenir'. I was 16 and had just discovered photoshop, so I edited a picture of my brother with Daniel Radcliffe to make it look like they'd met. I printed it, framed it, and gave it to him without telling him it was fake. He loved it and fully believed he’d met Daniel. Soon, he had an entire story about the meeting; what they talked about, how Daniel hugged him, etc. It was so sweet, and none of us (my family and I) had the heart to tell him the truth.

Fast forward 14 years, and my brother still didn’t know that the old, low quality picture of him meeting Daniel Radcliffe is fake. I never told him because his memory of the fake meeting felt so real to him that it became one of his proudest stories. Over time the memory became less important and the framed picture had been packed away in some box, and my brother has long outgrown his Harry Potter obsession. Yesterday, however, we were at our parents' home and we were bringing up old memories, you know how it goes. The story of meeting Daniel Radcliffe came up, and thinking it was harmless, I told him the truth. I thought he’d laugh but instead he got visibly upset. He didn’t want to believe me at first, thinking I was messing with him. I told him the real story of how and why I did it. He told me that it feels like I robbed him of a real childhood memory that he really cherished, and he feels embarrassed thinking about all the times he's told people about meeting Daniel Radcliffe in person, even recently. We ended our conversation on a semi-good note, though. I apologised for not telling him sooner, because I do feel bad that it meant so much to him even now. But I don’t regret it. Back then, it made him so happy during a rough time, and I don’t regret giving him that joy. I just didn't realize how much it still meant to him. So I'm just wondering, am (or was) I the a-hole?

My (25f)’s girlfriend (26f-Lotta) has always been on the more quiet and reserved side but also incredibly kind and conscientious of other people. She also doesn’t let others walk over her and knows how to set (and stick to) boundaries which is one of the reasons I was attracted to her. But a few weeks ago, I think she was too ruthless.

A few weeks ago, our upstairs neighbour (who Lotta and I are close with) showed up at our door sobbing and begging Lotta to babysit her 5 year old for an hour because her one month old was having trouble breathing and has stopped breathing at one point and needed to go to the hospital ASAP. The neighbour explained her mother was on the way as they speak but she has no one else to take care of her other son. She also offered to pay Lotta. I was at work at the time.

Lotta said no. She said she was busy and couldn’t do it. The neighbour ended up taking both kids to the hospital. I found out about this incident when I got home from work and Lotta told me. I was genuinely surprised to hear she said no which seemed to annoy Lotta.

Its been 3 weeks since that event and our neighbour has been quite cold to Lotta and this really bothers her. She says she was just setting boundaries and that our neighbour was entitled and snobby for being upset that Lotta said no. I explained I felt differently and am more on our neighbour's side as 1) she has never asked us for any favours in the 3 years we've known her and 2) this was a medical emergency- not her wanting to go clubbing with her friends. I told Lotta that she didn't teach our neighbour a lesson,, she only added stress she didn't need.

This really upset Lotta because she thought I would be on her side. She then asked me to talk to our neighbour to try and rekindle their friendship. I said I can't do that for her, she needs to apologise herself and put in the work.

Lotta stormed off and now keeps saying I'm being a huge asshole for not siding with her and helping her with our neighbour who is 'her friend'.

AITA?

Lotta said no. She said she was busy and couldn’t do it. The neighbour ended up taking both kids to the hospital. I found out about this incident when I got home from work and Lotta told me. I was genuinely surprised to hear she said no which seemed to annoy Lotta.

Its been 3 weeks since that event and our neighbour has been quite cold to Lotta and this really bothers her. She says she was just setting boundaries and that our neighbour was entitled and snobby for being upset that Lotta said no. I explained I felt differently and am more on our neighbour's side as 1) she has never asked us for any favours in the 3 years we've known her and 2) this was a medical emergency- not her wanting to go clubbing with her friends. I told Lotta that she didn't teach our neighbour a lesson,, she only added stress she didn't need.

This really upset Lotta because she thought I would be on her side. She then asked me to talk to our neighbour to try and rekindle their friendship. I said I can't do that for her, she needs to apologise herself and put in the work.

Lotta stormed off and now keeps saying I'm being a huge asshole for not siding with her and helping her with our neighbour who is 'her friend'.

AITA?

I (30M) have been married to the wife (30F) for almost 3 yrs.. 2 yrs ago, I moved to the other side of the country (US) for wife's job. She and her family are from the Middle-East. Her sister lives in the next state over.

Each time they've visited, they go out as a family to dinner/brunch at a nice place without me. I expressed it made me uncomfortable and felt disrespectful especially considering they were staying here. This continued to happen with every visit. I expressed my increasing discomfort and anger with each occurrence.

Cue current visit. They are to be here in our home from Thursday-Tuesday.

After work, at 7:45 I go out to the deck for a smoke and to decompress. 8:25PM MIL comes to the deck and tells me dinner reservation is at 8:30 and to get ready.

No one told me anything? I go upstairs and wife is getting ready in a room. I pop in and incredulously ask her why she didn't tell me about dinner?? Her response was:

""You could have asked, couldn't you?""

I tell her this is incredibly rude. She said this is about FIL's birthday. I go to my desk for more work and ask wife to let me know when she's done getting ready.

SIL and wife both pass behind me while getting wife ready not saying a word. I then hear them go downstairs and the front door closing. I go downstairs and they're gone. I called wife 4 times. No answer.

I am seething. I drive to cool off and get a call from wife 20min later.

I go off about why she didn't say anything to me and about how they all ditched me and how this is extremely disrespectful. She says:

""Oh, okay! I'll tell them you said so.""

They get back at 11:00 PM. SIL asks if I ate. I said yes even though I didn't. FIL looks at the TV and asks if I'm watching X. I curtly say yes. They say goodnight and go to bed.

Saturday morning, I go get breakfast. I took extra time bc I wanted to be anywhere away from them. I get a msg from FIL:

""We are making brunch for everyone.""

Wife txtd asking where I am.

I didn't reply.

FIL and MIL are in the kitchen saying brunch is ready and to please eat. I tell them ""I ate."" before heading upstairs to my desk to game for the first time in months. 

Wife comes and says something but I can't hear her.

6:30 PM I go downstairs to heat up food.

SIL is on the couch. Wife, MIL, and FIL walk downstairs. No one says anything to me. Wife is on the middle of the stairs when she yells:

""Is everyone stressed out and quiet because of that RUDE, boring, BUZZKILL!? Don't let that fat POS ruin your day.""

I respond:

""Oh, look. It's a talking garbage can. Hey Oscar!""

SIL looks at me and throws up her hands. I continue to eat my sandwich as everyone leaves.

Wife texts me that MIL is crying in the car because of how uncomfortable I made all of them. They are all leaving, wife included. I said their leaving is completely fine by me and that they're the ones who showed the disrespect first. They are all leaving tomorrow morning to a lake resort for the remainder of their time.

So, I’ve been getting some flak at work because a well-liked co-worker of ours got fired for repeated absences after I stopped giving him a ride to work.

As background, I’m an Active Duty Military mid-level healthcare provider and he was an entry level civilian contractor. We both worked at a large Military Hospital.

Earlier this year, “John [20m],” who recently started working at the hospital, was asking around our department for people he could carpool with. Everyone gave various reasons why they couldn’t help, and eventually I volunteered because he lived nearby and it wouldn’t be out of my way to pick him up.

(I will preface this by noting John was very well liked in our department with most of the older ladies adopting him as their “work son” etc. He’s also the youngest employee by almost a decade.)

This issues started about one month in when I noticed every morning after I picked him up, he would bring various food products to eat on the drive to work. This didn’t bother me at first, but as time went on he was leaving food trash and crumbs in my vehicle. I’m an extremely clean individual, so this bothered me and I said something. He continued eating, and kept forgetting to clean after himself. I was getting tired of constantly reminding him to take his trash with him, and I started just throwing the trash away myself. After doing this a few times, I decided to just leave the trash, and see if he would notice.

He didn’t. For weeks the empty water bottles, redbull cans, candy wrappers and empty containers started to pile up in by passenger door and floorboard, and stayed until I asked him politely “could you take that trash with you?” His response of “yeah of course, I don’t mind” made me feel like he thought it was MINE and I was asking for a favor. 

There’s more examples, but to keep things short, I gave him an ultimatum, he needed to clean up after himself and respect my car, or he would need to find another ride to work.

Not even a week later, he was eating some type of meal with flaky crackers and it was spilling on his lap the entire ride to work. When we pulled into the parking garage, he dusted all the food crumbs from his lap onto my carpet. We left the car and went to work. After work, when I returned to my car, there were ants inside of my vehicle.

I had enough. So I made up an excuse, and told him I couldn’t give him rides.

He took it well, and the rides stopped. But over the next few weeks, his tardiness started to pile up. His agency fired him in September. We are not privy to contractors personnel issues, but everyone assumes he was fired for being chronically late.

Fast forward to today, while on break, I overheard some folks saying he was fired because I stopped giving him a ride to work and that was selfish of me etc. I never told anyone except him why I stopped, and I’m assuming he told them some half baked truth and because he was well liked, I know they believe him.

My contractor told me later that the owners of those vehicles were shouting and cussing them out until the police made them leave. I went by after work and a guy confronted me about being as ass for having their vehicles towed. He was shouting about how I ruined their day because they missed work and their kids were late to school because. He also said it cost almost $1,000 to get all 3 vehicles back and that I’ll be covering the cost. I told him good luck with that and that he’s the ass for parking in my garage without my permission. We went back and forth until his wife came and pulled him home.

Some of the other neighbors came out to watch our argument and afterwards some of them told me I was starting off on the wrong foot and should apologize to that guy. They said that I should be more neighborly and understand that neighbors help each other out. One said that I should have left a note instead of having them towed.

I (F35) am gluten free (celiac) and have been for over half my life. My husband (M35) is not. We had two friends stopping by for dinner who are also not gluten free. 

My husband suggested we get pizza and mentioned to me that one of the friends only eats chicken as far as meat goes, so I should factor that into my order. I said, “well that doesn’t really affect me since I wasn’t planning on sharing, but noted, I’ll see what options they have for her.” Husband freaks out at me, because apparently I’m being ungrateful? He asked why I didn’t want to share and I said, “the gluten free pizzas are basically personal pizzas, and I regularly eat the whole thing when we order it. I’m supposed to offer half of mine to other people when I can’t eat what they are eating?” He wouldn’t hear me at all and said if I didn’t want to share I could pay for my own pizza myself. I don’t really care about paying for it myself but the idea that I’m supposed to give away some of my dinner when I can’t eat what other people are eating is stupid to me. It’s not like we are ordering every pizza gluten free. It just doesn’t make sense! They eat my food, I can’t eat their food. I can understand the principle of offering but… one gf pizza from this place is only enough for one person. If we were getting multiple gf ones I’d absolutely share, but they got two larges for the three of them. He continued to go on about how ungrateful I was being and said some other stupid stuff before I told him to fuck off and went upstairs. 

I ended up just going upstairs and not eating or seeing them at all. I came downstairs later and he had ordered me a gluten free pizza and said from across the room, “are you ready for your Grateful Free pizza? You need to have a better attitude about things that aren’t yours in the future.” I didn’t reply or eat the pizza (I was already heating something else up and hadn’t noticed the pizza, but I will eat it later because I’m pregnant and starving all the time.)

Just for the record, this has happened before several years ago where we ordered pizza and only one gf for me, and it arrived and everyone thought mine looked super good (I don’t order regular pepperoni/tomato sauce) so the four other people (husband included) took over half my pizza before I even got a bite. It pissed me off because I then didn’t have enough food and they still had plenty PLUS pieces of mine. So perhaps this is a sore subject for me.

Kimmy is starting high school soon and her school sent a list of their extracurriculars. I want my children to be academically inclined and join clubs to meet people. I told Kimmy to pick some clubs, and as of right now she picked out 10 (which we are definitely going to shorten down).

Kimmy sent a list of clubs to her father so he could help her. He didn't respond and instead, I got a call from Dave's wife, Amy, a little later. Amy asked me if Kimmy was really going to join all of those clubs, and I said not all but probably some of them.

Amy followed by asking if Kimmy could only join one of the clubs on her list, which confused me. I asked why. Amy explained that she has to go to work soon, and she really needs someone to take care of her kids. She was hoping that Kimmy would be able to go to their house straight after school and take care of them.

Amy has 3 kids under 13, and recently had a baby with Dave. Kimmy has ADHD which makes it hard for her to care for her own needs. I already feel extremely uncomfortable leaving her with 4 kids that young unattended. Amy didn't even mention transportation and how Kimmy would get there. I told her no.

This upset Amy. She told me that Kimmy is a part of her family too, and as a family they all need to chip in and according to her, Kimmy should chip in by babysitting. She ranted on, giving me a sob story as to how she was struggling already with Dave working, how hard it was to be mom to 4 kids who depend on her so much, and how expensive childcare was nowadays.

I told her no, and why I was uncomfortable, to which she just reiterated her story (this happened twice). By this time, I said no 3 times and she was still asking. I thought it was clear that no meant no, not no and ask again later. I interrupted her and told her no is my final answer and she's honestly pathetic to ask a 14-year-old for support and it sounds she needs to grow up instead of relying on children to pick up her slack.

As you would expect, Amy and Dave are upset at me, which I don't really mind. My only issue is that when I told my sister, she thought I was being cruel which is making me rethink things. AITA?

Edit: A common question I'm being asked is what custody looks like. My kids go to their father's one week every month and stay with me for the rest. But there are times where they stay at their father's longer than expected (with my permission). For instance, the kids stayed a couple weeks at their father for the summer. Sometimes they stay an extra few days, but the custody is officially me 3/4 and him 1/4, with me being their primary caregiver.

Edit2: A lot of you guys are asking about Amy's kids. The oldest is around my son's age albeit a bit older, and I literally have no idea if their father is helping them or if they have the same father because it's none of my business and those are not at all my kids.

Edit3: While I'm very glad a lot you fellow millennials liked The Babysitter Club, can you please stop using it as a reference? I've read some ridiculous comments on this post, but using fictional 12-year-olds who acted like teenagers as a reason for my child to babysit are one of the most ridiculous ones I've seen.

Edit4: Additionally, I don't think struggling moms should be bashed, but they should be treated like humans and need to know when boundaries were crossed. Dave and I have been co-parenting for a while, so there was a time when I was in Amy's shoes and wondering what I would do with my kiddos.

Here were some examples from over the years:



Ellie stole a hair ribbon from another girl? The other girl was lying because she was jealous of Ellie.



The teacher gave Ellie an F because she didn’t do the work? The teacher is also jealous of Ellie. (Also yea I know there are bad teachers out there and have had a few myself. But every single one and all the time? Really?)



Ellie’s sister “Annie” hasn’t talked to Ellie since moving out? Nothing happened and Jenny has no idea why Annie is refusing contact. (Jenny is so in denial about this one especially. Something obviously happened that Jenny doesn’t want to admit to.)



Mom notices this too, but she usually just changes the subject away from Ellie but never says anything about it directly to Jenny because she doesn’t want it to hurt the friendship. Jenny usually does take the hint and changes the subject.



Mom took me to a baby shower where Jenny happened to be, so they obviously talked and my mom mentioned that me and my friends have a camping trip planned soon. Jenny was openly hinting that I she wanted me to invite Ellie too. Mom picked up on it and basically tried inviting Ellie along. So before she finished her sentence I loudly said “Oh Hell no!”



Jenny clearly wasn’t happy, and Mom told me that my trip was cancelled. By the time we got home, she luckily changed her mind about canceling the trip but was still pissed at me. I said that her and Jenny have been friends forever, but I didn’t choose to be Ellie’s friend, and didn’t want her coming along. 



Mom said she knows I don’t have a great opinion of Ellie and that she knows Ellie has plenty of issues, but I should have declined respectfully instead of embarrassing Jenny and was capable of saying something like “Sorry, I would prefer nobody else come since we don’t have room or supplies for another person/my friends aren’t comfortable with someone they know well coming along”



I realize I could have been more respectful, but I was also trying to put a stop to that immediately. Also, we got some looks, just because I admit I was pretty loud, but everyone outside of Jenny and Mom seemed to move on almost immediately. So I think she’s turning the “embarrassment” into a bigger deal than it actually was. AITA?","AITA For embarrassing my aunt at a baby shower instead of showing tact and declining an invitation request more respectfully?My mom and “Jenny” have been best friends since they were little, we aren’t actually related but I still call her “Aunt Jenny.” Jenny’s daughter “Ellie” is also 16 and Jenny is sadly the kind of mom who thinks Ellie is never wrong.



Here were some examples from over the years:



Ellie stole a hair ribbon from another girl? The other girl was lying because she was jealous of Ellie.



The teacher gave Ellie an F because she didn’t do the work? The teacher is also jealous of Ellie. (Also yea I know there are bad teachers out there and have had a few myself. But every single one and all the time? Really?)

I (23M) and my roommate Justin (23M) are med students. We've been living together as roommates for two years, and  we live in a hostel. 

Last week were our final year exams, and it was absolute hell. We were surviving on 2-3 hours of sleep daily, fueled by coffee and energy drinks (I know it’s not healthy but there’s no other way to pass lol). 

On the last day of exams, Justin was unusually exhausted. Around 1 am, he decided to sleep and told me to wake him up at 3 am. I agreed.

However, by 2:30 am, I was dead. My brain was shutting down, my notes were getting blurry and I knew if I stayed up any longer, I'd pass out. I decided to wake Justin up early.

I woke Justin up at 2:30 am and told him the time and suggested he set an alarm so he wouldn't oversleep. Justin sat upright, rubbed his eyes, and nodded and said ‘alright’. 

I was like ‘don’t forget to set the alarm’ and then almost instantly fell asleep.

We both woke up at 8 AM. (I had set my alarm for 6 but I kept hitting snooze). Justin freaked out, accusing me of not waking him up as promised. 

I reminded him that I did wake him up at 2:30 AM and suggested he set an alarm. Justin said that he was too sleepy to comprehend what’s happening and insisted that I should have stayed awake to wake him at 3 AM or at least made sure he was fully awake before sleeping. 

Justin's exam didn't go well, and now he's blaming me.

I understand his frustration, but I think he's being unfair.

Three years ago Cheryl pulled me (15m) aside and told me about the affair and that she wanted my help to make my siblings still love her when they found out. She was someone we were all close with. I'm the baby of the family and the ""favorite"" of everyone, which I don't see as true, but it's a bit of a joke and I am the baby so I do get people looking out for me more. This is something Cheryl tried to use to her advantage. She put me in the worst position by telling me about the affair because she hoped my siblings would love me too much to hate her if I told them not to. I was so angry at her and at dad. I didn't want to be the one to tell mom. I didn't want to see her break down. But I knew I needed to. Mom was furious, more at Cheryl for involving me than the affair at first. My dad defended Cheryl and said she had known me my whole life and should be allowed to confide in me. It turned into a really big fight. My siblings hated them more for trying to involve me too.

During the divorce we all said we wanted to stay with mom. The judge ruled I had to go to my dad's until I was 14. So for two years I had to go to dad's house every other week. I made it my mission to make life harder for them that whole time. I refused to go along with the happy family shit they tried to pull. Which only got WAY worse when Cheryl was pregnant and they wanted to do a pregnancy reveal with me in it and I said no. After the baby was born they thought I would soften and would want to know their baby, I didn't. The last time I was at their house Cheryl was pregnant again.

I turned 14 and stopped going. I refuse to answer texts from them either (can't block my dad until I turn 18). My siblings have them both blocked and they refuse to engage with them. Cheryl and my dad's families are living closer to them now and both ask about us and why we're not around. Dad's family have tried to reach out and get me to reconcile but I told them it would not happen and I hate my dad.

Cheryl confronted me while I was at the mall the other day. She followed me into different stores and said I have two younger siblings I should know and that I loved her before so I should stop punishing her and dad and start being more respectful. I had enough when I realized she wasn't going to walk away and I told her she's disgusting and repulsive for trying to use me to her advantage, a 12 year old kid, when she was having an affair with dad. I told her I would never show her any respect and she and dad could explain to their kids why they'll never be part of mine or my siblings lives. But I'm not going to let them guilt me into anything.

She has used dad's phone a bunch since then and I got over 100 texts already. Mom told them to stop and bullying a child after all they did makes them look even worse. The response back was I'm a disrespectful child who should be taught better.

I feel like it works better for my skills and generally would be a better job for me. My mom isn't super happy about it but she knows college has been pushed on me for almost two years and my mind hasn't changed. So she's accepted that she won't change my mind and nobody will.

Here's why my post is here. My dad died when I was 6. When he was 9 my grandmom (his mom) died and it was due to medical negligence/malpractice and my grandpa, uncle and dad were awarded compensation, a huge amount too, for her death. Granddad split it between my dad and uncle. He was working and received social security benefits for them because grandmom died and he knew she'd want them to be taken care of above everything. When my dad realized he was sick he made sure that money would go to me, his only kid. He set it up in a trust and left my granddad and uncle in charge of it. The money is a lot. Like I could easy be debt free going to college with it and have some left over if I was smart about it. My mom knew about the money but cannot access it.

My mom has been married to her husband for 9 years. My parents were separated when dad died, btw. Her husband has a son who's a year younger than me and has a medical condition. My mom also has two kids with her husband/my half siblings.

Because of my stepbrother's medical condition and his mom not being in his life or his mom's family, they don't really have any savings for his college anymore (they had to spend it for some medical stuff) and my half siblings have nothing either.

My mom and her husband think that since I have the money and won't be using it for college, I should give it to my stepbrother and half siblings and let them pay it back if I insist but that I could also just give it to them as a way to help them with their futures and be a good brother.

I said no and I told them I wouldn't change my mind. Mom asked why and I said it's my inheritance from my dad. I could buy a house with it. I could protect my future with it. I could save it for my future kids. But I don't want to risk it not being paid back when it was dad's way of securing my future. She told me he'd want me to do this and I asked her if she really thinks he'd want the money he got from losing his mom to be used on random kids that aren't me. She told me they're not random to me so yes. She believes he'd want me to be a good brother. She told me I should really give it more consideration.

Most of our guests are friends, and everyone agreed to bring a dish. One of his friends, let’s call her Chelsey, volunteered to make the turkey.

On Thanksgiving day, one of his other friends asked if she could bring her cat. I said no pets because, as mentioned, we live in a small apartment, and it’s a dinner gathering. I didn’t think it would be comfortable for anyone, including the pets. My husband suggested we also let Chelsey know about our no-pet rule, and I agreed. I was a bit hesitant, though, because Chelsey is one of those people who likes to bring her dog everywhere. If she can’t bring the dog, she arranges for a dog sitter. In the past, she has caused some tension when her dog wasn’t allowed at other events.

I told my husband to text her to check if she was planning on bringing her dog, as I didn’t think it would be a good idea. I also offered to talk to her myself because my husband isn’t as comfortable with confrontations. He texted her, and she called afterward.

Chelsey told me she always brings her dog everywhere, and I pointed out that wasn’t entirely true, since we’ve been to several events where she didn’t bring the dog (which is true). She then asked why we hadn’t mentioned this before the invitation, and I explained that I didn’t think it was necessary to mention it since I assumed it was understood that bringing pets to a dinner without asking isn’t typical, especially when we don’t even have pets ourselves.

At this point, she got upset and said, “Well, I guess you’ll have Thanksgiving without a turkey then.” I was surprised because it felt like she was trying to pressure me into letting her bring the dog, implying that she wouldn’t come without it. I don’t like being pressured, especially in my own home, so I calmly responded that I was sorry she felt that way.

He left me his entire estate, including the house after my grandma divorced him. Before he passed, my grandma had asked him to let her son (my uncle, 50M, not biologically related to my grandfather) rent the house. They set up a 3-year contract for $1800 a month, and at the end, he could buy the house for $377K. The contract ends this November.

After a lengthy probate process, the house is now officially in my name. My uncle asked if I’d extend the contract because of high interest rates, but I didn’t want to—I'm hoping to buy my own home soon. My grandma pressured me, saying “it’s family,” so I reluctantly agreed to extend it for 3 more years. 

While I was waiting for a new contract to be drafted, my uncle asked if he could start construction on the house. I said no, but then a friend of mine (who was doing the work) told me that my uncle had already started construction without my permission. I went to check it out, and sure enough, major work had been done without permits. I confronted him, and he denied it until I showed him photos. He claimed it was “his house” and that he could do what he wanted.

Later, during a family holiday, my uncle and his girlfriend ambushed me, proposing a 5-year contract with lenient rent terms, no restrictions on construction, and permission to sublet. I refused and said I’d have my lawyer draft the contract instead. During probate, my uncle and his girlfriend discussed what they would prefer contract wise that left it more open-ended. I continuously listened to their wants; however, I told them in the end I would send them a contract drafted by my lawyer once the house was in my name. 

A few months later, my uncle, his girlfriend, and my grandmother sent me the 5-year contract they had proposed during the family holiday. I firmly declined. My grandmother then called and berated me for not signing, claiming that if it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t have inherited anything from my grandpa. At that point, I lost my temper and said, “You have to be f\*cking kidding me.” She responded, “Your grandpa would be disappointed in you for using that language with me.” I replied, “Don’t use my grandpa against me,” and hung up.

Since then, my grandma and uncle have cut me off. I had my lawyer draft a new contract: 3 years, no subletting, and a clause requiring my approval for construction, the rest of the original contract (from my grandpa) is the same. Now my uncle is saying he can only qualify for $350K instead of the $377K he owes, and my family is pressuring me to accept the lower offer, accusing me of forcing him out.

AITA for refusing his contract, insisting he pay the full $377K, signing my contract, or moving out, and standing my ground despite family pressure?

","AITA for kicking my uncle out of “his” house?I (23M) was very close to my grandfather, who passed away last year. He left me his entire estate, including the house after my grandma divorced him. Before he passed, my grandma had asked him to let her son (my uncle, 50M, not biologically related to my grandfather) rent the house. They set up a 3-year contract for $1800 a month, and at the end, he could buy the house for $377K. The contract ends this November.

After a lengthy probate process, the house is now officially in my name. My uncle asked if I’d extend the contract because of high interest rates, but I didn’t want to—I'm hoping to buy my own home soon. My grandma pressured me, saying “it’s family,” so I reluctantly agreed to extend it for 3 more years. 

While I was waiting for a new contract to be drafted, my uncle asked if he could start construction on the house. I said no, but then a friend of mine (who was doing the work) told me that my uncle had already started construction without my permission. I went to check it out, and sure enough, major work had been done without permits. I confronted him, and he denied it until I showed him photos. He claimed it was “his house” and that he could do what he wanted.

Later, during a family holiday, my uncle and his girlfriend ambushed me, proposing a 5-year contract with lenient rent terms, no restrictions on construction, and permission to sublet. I refused and said I’d have my lawyer draft the contract instead. During probate, my uncle and his girlfriend discussed what they would prefer contract wise that left it more open-ended. I continuously listened to their wants; however, I told them in the end I would send them a contract drafted by my lawyer once the house was in my name. 

A few months later, my uncle, his girlfriend, and my grandmother sent me the 5-year contract they had proposed during the family holiday. I firmly declined. My grandmother then called and berated me for not signing, claiming that if it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t have inherited anything from my grandpa. At that point, I lost my temper and said, “You have to be f\*cking kidding me.” She responded, “Your grandpa would be disappointed in you for using that language with me.” I replied, “Don’t use my grandpa against me,” and hung up.

Since then, my grandma and uncle have cut me off. I had my lawyer draft a new contract: 3 years, no subletting, and a clause requiring my approval for construction, the rest of the original contract (from my grandpa) is the same. Now my uncle is saying he can only qualify for $350K instead of the $377K he owes, and my family is pressuring me to accept the lower offer, accusing me of forcing him out.

After years of waiting, I suggested she consider IVF treatment. I even helped her research the process and find clinics. She loved the idea and decided to go ahead with it.

Emily had the financial means to afford IVF on her own, but it meant she had to cut back on creature comforts and luxuries for the foreseeable future. Two months ago, after her fourth round of treatment, she got pregnant. The whole family is very happy for her and she's happy too. She didn't expect it to take so many rounds of treatment, though, so the bill ended up higher than she was prepared for. She does have enough money to support herself, but not very comfortably. She asked our family for help so she wouldn’t have to make even more sacrifices. Our parents are retired and living on a fixed income so they can't contribute much. This leaves me as her main source of potential financial support.

Last week Emily sat me down and asked me for money. I have no issue with people choosing to be single parents if they can afford it. But I don't believe it's fair to ask others to finance such a personal choice especially when there are significant long-term financial commitments involved.

I have a wife and a newborn son. While we do have some extra money, we're using it to keep our own little family comfortable and save for a bigger house (currently live in a single bedroom condo). I told Emily that I wouldn't be able to help her foot the bill.

Emily was heartbroken and furious. She argued that family is supposed to support each other and that I'm being selfish and judgmental. Our parents are also upset with me, saying that I'm not being a good brother. They think I should help her because she's family and this is her dream. They're especially upset because it was my idea and I helped her research it. I offered to help Emily by letting her eat dinner with us nightly since she lives nearby and letting her use my car which is cheaper to run since it's electric. She said that's not nearly enough.

I have my own family to think about and financial goals to achieve. I feel it's unreasonable to put myself in a difficult financial position for something that is Emily's personal choice, even if I initially suggested it. So AITA for not supporting her financially?

ETA: My sister is a homeowner with a *slightly* bigger house than mine, making *slightly* more money than I do. She can absolutely afford a child. She took from savings to pay for the fourth round of IVF and is rebuilding it as fast as possible by not spending. It isn't like she didn't budget, she just doesn't like being frugal. She also did take me up on the offer to temporarily trade cars and eat dinner with my family nightly. IVF was not my first suggestion. She wouldn't adopt because she wants a biological child. She did not use donor IUI because she wanted PGT done to ensure she'd have a boy because that's what she's wanted since high school.

How it is so mean that we flaunt our lifestyle while her kids are struggling and the least we could do is bring her and her kids home something. It’s 1 am. Her kids aren’t even awake. My sister said she deserves a little treat time to time and more say around the home. 

My wife flips on her and tells my sister she needs to move out ASAP she doesn’t want her toxic ass in her home anymore and if she’s not out in 30 days she will be getting the courts and child services involved to remove them from the home and my wife told my sister how she’s a mentally unstable unfit mother. 

My sister acted like I would protect her and she called my wife a bitch and saying I wouldn’t let that happen. I told my sister my wife can do as she wants and it’s her home too. My sister is the one who made herself unwelcome. 

My sister didn’t apologize but made us breakfast this morning and my wife threw the plate of food away and told my sister 29 days. My wife left to go speak to one of her cousins who is a lawyer this morning. My sister acted all innocent in front of her kids who could tell their aunts attitude was off.

During the entire 15 mins of me being in the bathroom, the baby was crying so hard that he was losing his breath. I was wondering why he was crying for so long, so I came out of the bathroom and found that my husband had brought the baby swing into the kitchen and left the baby to cry while he cooked dinner on the stove. The babys face was red and tears down his face. I grabbed his pacifier and tried to calm him down a bit, and my husband became irritated that i was fussing over the baby instead of getting in the shower. I went to the sink to grab a clean bottle, intending to make a bottle and sit down to feed him so he stops crying. My husband reacted instantly. He swore at me, and grabbed the bottle himself and started making it. He said I was ruining his plan for the night, and that I was taking over.

One room has 2 full size beds, the other a king bed. I asked if he would mind sharing a room with me as 3 bedrooms in this area were harder to find.

He was the boy with the bad reputation for dumb shit, and by dumb shit I mean, not stuff he did but stuff he didn't do, like going home or having an adult around him. His mom was an addict who didn't let him come home before 12am on any given night. So he'd spend his time in different places which made adults think poorly of him. By the time people realized it was because he had a crappy mother they judged him for her actions. My parents were some of those judgemental people. They'd see him out past dark and make comments.

They were awful when Jamie and I started dating. I told them they considered themselves Christian and should be more understanding and welcoming of someone who didn't have a good home life. They'd say he wasn't trying, like he could do anything about his mom. They judged him for not going to college. They deemed him lazy for not going even though he held a job until he was 14 and with the help of the couple he'd worked for, went to trade school.

My parents were so shitty about it all that we didn't talk for a whole year. Then they reached out via my siblings to apologize to me and they appeared to accept Jamie and realize they had been wrong about him. Jamie always got along with my siblings. But he started to get along with my parents too and it was nice.

We got married two years ago and we welcomed our first baby together in June.

Last month we had a big fight. They showed that they kept their opinions to themselves for this long but they never saw Jamie as a good person, they always saw him as trash. And it all started because Jamie was alone with the baby for an entire day and they were horrified I trusted him to watch our child without me there. They spewed such hateful things about Jamie that aren't true. He's an amazing dad and husband. He's not his mother. He has never been in trouble with the law. So the fact they spoke about him like he was some criminal? I was so pissed. I kicked them out and told them I was done with them. 

We're still good with my siblings which is where this post is taking us. We started talking Christmas and Jamie and I said we'd host them. My mom was trying to get my siblings to ask me if I'd come to Christmas dinner at their house with the baby. One sibling said Jamie and I were hosting. Upon learning that my mom took said siblings phone and called and asked me how I could leave them uninvited. I told her if they ever want to be invited to anything again they will truly reflect on their actions and words and make a real and heartfelt apology to Jamie. But that is the only way. And it has to be real and to him and not me. I then hung up on my mom.

My parents are now claiming I'm trying to blackmail them, which I don't think they truly know what that means. And a text (I assume is from mom) accused me of being disrespectful of my parents and saying you can't demand an apology.

A little backstory: she had a horrible pregnancy right from the first trimester and had to quit her job since she was spending too much time out of the office. Her ex-boyfriend turned out to be a POS who claimed Maya had cheated on him and pinned the baby on him, and when my family insisted on taking a paternity test as soon as the baby was born, he agreed but went out for some milk before the due date.

After Lucas was born, finances became too tricky with a newborn and Maya’s postpartum complications. She asked if I could let her stay with me temporarily so she doesn’t have to pay rent and I agreed. I have an extra room in my house (which I inherited from my grandma) so I don’t have to worry about rent either.

Long story short, it’s been tough living with a baby whose mother needs so much more help than one person can provide. Our parents live too far to be of any help. Anyway, I didn’t mind waking up half the time to give Lucas his bottle or staying with him when she needed some time to herself. I also paid for everything baby-related. Hospital bills for both her and my nephew, food, clothes, and diapers, you name it. But now that both Maya and my nephew are stable enough that she resumed working, she started pushing for more. She expected me to keep paying for everything, but I told her it’s harder now that I’m not putting in as many hours and I get paid per hour. Still, she buys nothing and I end up paying anyway. She also thinks it doesn’t make sense to pay for daycare when I’m home most of the day. I ended up paying for it myself when she wouldn't.

(I think it’s important to add I refused to adopt Lucas. Everyone has always known I will adopt a child or more in the future but when Maya asked, I didn’t think she would be willing to stay in her bio son’s life as an aunt, and I don't think the confusion would do anyone any good.)

So Monday, she asked me to take Lucas to his hospital appointment and I said no. I told her to take a day off for that, because my job hasn’t been doing well lately as I’ve been spending too much time taking care of Lucas. She pointed out how this is my nephew and if I adopt kids, I will need to make sacrifices too, to which I said ""I will make them when the time comes but I’m not Lucas’s dad and although I'm happy to help where I can, I shouldn’t be expected to change my life for him.""

Maya took a day off but since the appointment, she hasn’t spoken to me except a yes/no mumble when I talk to her, and she’s been keeping Lucas in her room when he’s not at daycare. I love the little guy with all my life, and I’m wondering if maybe I took things too far. AITA?

ETA because I can't reply to all the comments. I may have caused some gender confusion with my phrasing but I am female (we're identical twins).

","AITA for having attitude with my mother after she didn't help me when I fainted bc she thought ""I was faking it""?Today, I (15f) was helping my parents and holding up a very heavy object for them when all of a sudden my vision started going black and I thought I was going to throw up. I remember asking my mom please, please, please take this from me I have to let it go I don't feel so good. I'm actually sick and I think I'm gonna faint or throw up, I can't see (she probably thinks I fake other illnesses when in reality I just have a stupid weak immune system). So, I proceed to black out on the concrete and come to my senses after some time (this is outside in front of our house where they were working and my mom could clearly see me, not sure how long I was out, probably a few minutes) with my ear and body hurting like hell. I am completely out of it and stumble to a piece of grass 20 or so ft away and conk out again (at this point I thought i was going to throw up).

I have never posted here before, so my apologies if I make any mistakes. 

I (54f) have been invited by a friend (50f) who I will call Ann, to come to her house for Thanksgiving.  

We all live in Italy, but spent many years in the USA, and have several American friends in the area.  

Ann heard that I make a traditional Thanksgiving dinner at my house every year for my family and a couple friends (6 people total).  

It is quite difficult to get all of the supplies here (no buying canned pumpkin, or cranberry sauce!), so I make every single thing from scratch.  Over the years, I’ve also acquired all the dishes and tools and spices - know suppliers for the more exotic things, and am an all around good cook. 

So Ann, who was born in China but lived in the USA for 20+ years, asked if I would come to her beautiful (and much bigger) home, and “teach her” how to make the whole dinner.  

For a group of 12 people instead of the usual 6.  

I was hesitant at first, because we live a very modest lifestyle, and Ann and her (British) husband are very well off, but I figured it would still be fun, and I would enjoy putting on the feast for new people and in a beautiful kitchen. 

After I agreed, the problems began.  First, Ann wanted to have the dinner on a day that isn’t Thanksgiving, to make it more convenient.  I decided it wasn’t all that important, since we live in Italy.  So it is scheduled for the Sunday prior to the actual day. 

Then when we were planning to meet to go shopping for all the ingredients, she asked if I could do all the shopping and she would “reimburse me for her half”. 

I asked what she meant, and she said that I’d be paying for half of everything. 

So not only would I be doing all the shopping, all the planning, all the cooking and teaching her as well, but now I’m expected to pay for the food? 

I told her I could not do this (we really don’t have the budget!) so now she’s trying to alter the menu she agreed to (turkey & fixings, candied yams, roasted veggies, an appetizer, and pie).  Really a modest dinner by American standards. 

She then made a comment that “her” friends don’t “eat like pigs”.

She then went to another guest *with my recipes* and asked her to prepare my pumpkin pie so she didn’t have to buy the ingredients. 

Bear in mind, Ann and her husband are very wealthy.  I’d estimate the whole dinner for 12 might cost €200 for the ingredients, and my labor Ann gets for free. 

She thinks I’m being “stubborn and ungenerous” (ie an AH) 

My family thinks Ann is  taking advantage of my kindness and her miserly ways are ridiculous, since she’d spend double that amount for lunch out on a whim. 

So AITA for refusing to “contribute” to the meal or be bullied into this nonsense?  My family wants me to just bow out and tell her I’m not comfortable with her attitude.  I’m tempted, because this feels toxic and manipulative.

When I (15M) was 13 my mother (a bisexual woman) cheated on my dad with one of her female friends from college she reconnected with. My parents divorced, and my mom married her partner. 

I’m an only child and I live with my mom during the week. We’re quite close. Her partner makes a lot of money. So much money that my mom thinks it doesn’t make sense for her to work and she’s a stay at home mom.

My relationship with my moms partner is tense. At first, I didn’t mind her. Since my mom doesn’t work her partner provides for her. As long as she provided for my mom and made her happy, I didn’t care. My mom provides for me with child support money from my dad. 

Issues started quickly arising when my moms partner started intruding on my life. She tried to look through my laptop but couldn’t crack my password and demanded I open it for her. I refused. There was a massive argument and my mom took my side which caused tension between my mom and her partner. Next she started judging me for my eating habits and weight. She started making comments about how I’m “looking chubbier than usual” and should stop eating so much fast food. I literally eat what my mom cooks at home. She also demands since it’s her house, I always keep my room clean and organized. I have no issue with this, she is right. What bugs me is that she will come into my room at like 6am and will yell at me while I’m asleep to start cleaning.

All this BS results in a lot of daily arguments between us. I’ve started going to my dads after school instead. This causes my mom to freak out and beg me to go home to her. I hate doing that but I love my mom and do it for her.

A few days ago, my mom sat me down with her partner and asked both of us if we could figure out a way to get along. A couple hours of discussion and there was an agreement to try to be more respectful. Despite this, a lot of the same behavior keeps going on. And today, on the birthday of my mom’s partner my mom asked if I was going to celebrate with them. I thought about it and said no. My mom told me I don’t have a choice since her partner provides for her we both owe her basic decency and respect. She told me to get ready and dress nicely since we were going out to eat. I had a fuck this moment so when my mom went to shower I decided to leave the house and walk to my dads place. 

My mom freaks the fuck out and calls me. I don’t pick up so she calls my dad and he tells her where I am. There is a huge argument between the two and at the end of it my dad congratulated me on standing up to my mom and her partner despite being such a jerk to them.

My biological parents had me in their mid 20s but they ""weren't ready to be parents"" and asked my grandparents to raise me at the last minute, like 2 days before I was born last minute.

About a year and a half ago my biological parents returned and told the family they had kids. My grandparents didn't push me to interact or meet any of them so I stayed out of it. My grandparents only interacted twice. My biological parents chased after them to be more involved but my grandparents said no. The extended family didn't see them often either even though my biological parents really tried to act like it was all one big family around them again.

The discussion of inheritance and wills came up and my biological parents wanted to know if their kids had been added as equal grandkids and they said they heard I was being treated like a kid and why the hell was that happening. I was no more their kid than the other grandkids and I shouldn't take priority as a grandkid either since I was one of the oldest. I didn't need anything. My grandparents kicked them out and told them to get lost (in their more mature nature). This brought my biological parents to me and asking to have a serious talk and them blaming me for my grandparents not wanting to know their kids better. I rolled my eyes when they brought it up and it pissed them off and I just shut the door on them and my grandparents were outraged they approached me for the first time ever to shame me for their decisions that were not mine. But then my grandpa's brother was saying they had a point and that caused a fight between my grandparents and him and made me question stuff.

My grandparents are my favorite people though and I'm SO glad they raised me. They were amazing grandparents turned parents again.

About a year and a half ago my biological parents returned and told the family they had kids. My grandparents didn't push me to interact or meet any of them so I stayed out of it. My grandparents only interacted twice. My biological parents chased after them to be more involved but my grandparents said no. The extended family didn't see them often either even though my biological parents really tried to act like it was all one big family around them again.

The discussion of inheritance and wills came up and my biological parents wanted to know if their kids had been added as equal grandkids and they said they heard I was being treated like a kid and why the hell was that happening. I was no more their kid than the other grandkids and I shouldn't take priority as a grandkid either since I was one of the oldest. I didn't need anything. My grandparents kicked them out and told them to get lost (in their more mature nature). This brought my biological parents to me and asking to have a serious talk and them blaming me for my grandparents not wanting to know their kids better. I rolled my eyes when they brought it up and it pissed them off and I just shut the door on them and my grandparents were outraged they approached me for the first time ever to shame me for their decisions that were not mine. But then my grandpa's brother was saying they had a point and that caused a fight between my grandparents and him and made me question stuff.

I(19F) have a wedding to attend that is of some friends of my boyfriend. My mom(51F) offered to help me get ready. 

For context: my mom is gorgeous. She used to model, she has always been incredibly beautiful and she has an awesome body. My two brothers(33 and 31M) take after her, and are both handsome men. I am the only daughter, and as such, I think she expected someone like her. 

I am not like her. I was very thin when I was a kid, but I was a tomboy and hated everything feminine. Then puberty hit, and I gained a lot of weight. I’m not obese but I am your average chubby person. 77kg at 165cm: overweight but not overly so I guess. Also I don’t look a lot after myself in the sense that I don’t really go out of my way to do skincare, makeup, etc.

I love my mom, and she does truly love me, but she isn’t a kind person. All through my teenage years, she made a lot of harsh comments about my appearence and my weight. I’m a sensitive person, so this used to affect me a lot. I can usually take criticism fairly enough if it’s phrased nicely, but I can’t take it if there’s even a hint of mockery or meanness in it.  

Anyway, it’s not that big of a deal now. Years back I was honest with mom that her comments really affected my self esteem and she seemed to tone it down. Occasionally she will still do it but not often. She just can’t help herself, I think, it’s her way of showing love but it makes me hate myself. When I’m next to her she will scan my face for pimples and if she finds one she will actively ignore me to pop them, or I will be doing something alone and she will come over to comment that my hair looks bad and I need to use this different product, or I will be walking and she will comment that my belly is large and I should go to the gym. Things like that, I know they aren’t bad but I can’t take it.

To the situation at hand: she was giving me dresses to use to the wedding. We have always shared dresses, so this isn’t news. One of the dresses she lent me was one that she used two years ago at my graduation. I put it on, and it was pretty tight. Her and my aunt tried to force it to close but it was struggling. I said that they should stop but they continued to force it and the zipper basically broke down completely. When it happened, my mom blurted out “wow, you really are fat”. My aunt bursted out laughing and started teasing me about being chubby. I just kept silent. 

We tried on a few more dresses, I chose a pretty one that fit well and was elastic, and that was that. Then, afterwards, my mom asked me if I really had been going to the gym and said that I would have to suck in my belly during the wedding so it didn’t show so much in the dress I picked. I got fed up and told her that I was sick of her comments, and would buy my own dress to go. 

Mom thinks I blew up at her for nothing and am about to spend money over a tantrum. My siblings think I’m being dramatic and that I’m just mad I’m fat. My friends and boyfriend think I’m right.

I also have a biological daughter “Lyla” (12F). Mary and Lyla mostly get along, although there have been some minor arguments.

A few weeks ago, the police came to Lyla’s school. Someone had sent an anonymous message to the school saying that Lyla was in possession of drugs. After searching through her phone, locker, and bags, they realized that the ‘drugs’ in question were skittles that Lyla had lying around in her bag accidentally ripping open the packaging. Lyla was terrified of the police and was traumatized by the incident. She’s a very shy, quiet girl who had a panic attack at the thought of being sent to prison.

While they wouldn’t reveal who told on her, Lyla suspected that it was Mary since she was the only one who could have seen the skittles in her bag. Mary denied this at first, but eventually she snapped under pressure and admitted it. She said she made a mistake and was scared that Lyla would overdose like her parents.

I know that Mary has trauma related to drugs. But that’s not an excuse. I’ve made it very clear that she can come talk to me about anything, even if it involves Lyla, and yet she went to the school instead of telling me first. Mary said that she only went to the school in case I was biased towards Lyla. She knew full well the legal ramifications of her actions — both of them could have potentially been removed from my care.

I can’t help but think her intentions are malicious, Skittles look absolutely nothing like drugs. She didn’t even talk to me or Lyla about it, she just went straight to the authorities. So I decided to ground her, stop her allowance, increase her chores, and take away her electronics for the entire summer. She’s still upset with me for this, saying I went too far and I was punishing her for having trauma and trying to do the right thing. But I feel like I have a duty to teach her that it’s not okay to potentially get our entire family into legal trouble over a misunderstanding. AITA?

EDIT: The reason I thought she had malicious intentions was because the week before, Mary “coincidentally“ started a large argument with Lyla for hanging out with Mary’s crush.

A few weeks ago we went out shopping for groceries as my mum was away, she had put her favourite dip on the shopping list and wrote down exactly what brand it was. Dad couldn’t seem to find the dip and so decided to grab a random green dip and hope for the best, when i pointed out that the dip mum wanted was on the shelf above he grabbed it and seemed shocked that he didn’t see it.
Things like this are a regular occurrence and we kinda expect to get something different whenever he offers to get us something.
He never reads the containers or bottles and just grabs stuff at random most of the time.

Last night dad called me and asked me if I wanted anything from the liquor store as he was grabbing some wine, I said “can you please get me (brand) in raspberry please” he brings home the pineapple flavour and only realises it’s wrong when I point it out. 
Oh and he also got annoyed when I didn’t want to drink it as I dislike pineapple.

He tells me it’s the thought that counts even if he fucked up. That’s when I told him that it isn’t the thought that counts when you repeatedly get the wrong thing.

My Father-In-Law was so ecstatic at the news that he gifted us $4,000 for Christmas to help with medical bills and for the baby. 
 My Father-In-Law is a half owner of a multi state, multi million dollar business, of which my husband is slated to take over with his sister sometime next year. In our state it is a requirement to have a social security number prior to opening a bank account, which my daughter in utero did not have. Therefore, it was agreed to enter the money in our joint account until after our daughter was born. I don’t monitor this joint account because it’s at my husband’s bank, not mine. 
 To pay for medical costs associated with her birth, I had used my HSA, covering the full amount by myself. I also created her a bank account through my bank, which my husband was supposed to be a trustee on, but failed to sign the paperwork in time, so my dad was designated instead.  
 Today while driving home from an event, I asked about the $4K, considering our daughter is a year old, and asked for permission to withdraw the funds and enter it into our daughtpers legitimate account. My husband started claiming that I already used the money for medical bills, and that I cashed it into my personal account. I told him that I did not do that and showed him my account from that time period. 
 He said that if it was in the joint account it is gone, and that he used it towards hunting land, which I didn’t give the okay to drop that money towards. He then called me ridiculous for even bringing it up, and that our baby isn’t entitled to that money as it was for medical expenses and care of her which he barely pays anything towards. I pay 75% of daycare costs, and all of grocery bills including formula/milk, and the baby is covered under my healthcare plan as his health  plan is awful from his families business. We split our mortgage 50/50, but I was the one who paid for the entire down payment. 
 The whole situation  was brought up when it did, as I am beginning to struggle to make ends meet, and have been unable to transfer money every paycheck to our daughter’s account.

I believe adoption is a beautiful thing. However, the reality is that most adopted kids come from unfortunate situations and those situations can stigmatize adopted kids. People who don't have adopted kids don't understand that because they view the world through their lenses and how the world should be and not how it really is.

My kids are very happy and have a ton of friends. Last month, a gay couple moved on the block and they have three adopted boys who are within the same age range as my kids. The more that I got to know ""Mike"" and ""Dave"" the more I disliked them. However my kids liked their kids so I let it be.

Recently my kids stopped playing with their kids because they grew uncomfortable with being asked about their own adoption by Mike and Dave and other people who didn't ask before. My kids don't want to compare and contrast their adoption experiences for adult's entertainment and curiosity and then be judged. As a result, my kids stopped playing with Mike and Dave's kids.

This led to simmering anger towards me and eventually it came out when my 10yo declined to go to their son's birthday party. Actually no one showed up.

Yes, my kids are adopted too but they don't want to be around people who want to constantly remind them of it and remind them of trauma. That invites people who know nothing about us to start lecturing, shaming or giving unsolicited advice.

He had custody of me (16). My mom lives in another state. She moved when I was 7 because her husband got a new job and wanted a better life for his kids. Mom wanted to take me. She and dad battled it out in court. I was asked what I wanted by a judge. It was a really bad time for me. I told the judge I wanted my mom but didn't want to leave my dad, my friends or my family. I told him I really didn't want to go. She was really kind to me. I don't remember everything she said. But I do remember her apologizing for me being in that position. She decided to give dad custody of me and gave mom summer parenting time and weekly calls to me. I begged mom not to leave. She told me she had to but wanted me to come with them. I told her I didn't want to leave dad behind but I didn't want to be left behind. She left and told me nothing much would change.

For a while the calls were great and all. But then she started putting her her stepkids (who were under 5 when mom and her husband moved) on the phone after 2 minutes of us talking. The calls were meant to be for her and me. But she wanted me to ""keep the bond"" with her stepkids. I never had a bond with them so the calls sucked and I started ending the calls when she would pass the phone to everyone else. Mom never came back on the phone so I didn't need to stay on the phone. She'd correct me for it and I'd tell her I wanted to talk to her and not them. The calls stayed on the court order but they were at most 5 minutes instead of 20 minutes. 

Summers I spent 5-7 weeks with mom. She'd act so excited to see me but we never really got time for just us. Her stepkids were always added on because her husband would be at work and when he'd get home he'd join us. I asked for time with just my mom and she'd ignore me. I grew more resentful of it all.

My dad died right before I was due to fly out to mom's. I don't want to live with her so I asked my grandparents if they could file for custody quickly. There was an emergency hearing because of the situation and mom had to fly out for it. She wanted custody. She told the judge. But the judge said I could temporarily stay with my grandparents until a formal court date. Court is a little over a week away.

My mom has tried to convince me to move in with her. She told me I should be with my family and my parents. I told her she's my only parent left but she chose her husband and his kids over me before so why should I choose her now. She told me I should understand that she didn't want to end her marriage over a good opportunity and how I could have gone with them. She told me she couldn't let his kids down after she became mom to them. I told her she could separate me from one of my parents. Then I pointed out she prioritized them over me. She told me it's not a reason to make her life harder by having to fight for custody of her son who already lost his other parent. She told me to be fair about this.

I had a custom mocktail which cost $20-25 and a sparkling water. We agreed beforehand to split the bill but I took that to mean food (we had appetizers) and not that I would be required to pay for drinks. The other girls did order 2 champagne bottles along with cocktails. 

Then we got back home and I got a Venmo request for $470 which I was shocked by. I called my friend to ask what the breakdown was and they said it was split.

I (20f) have coached a sports camp over the summer for the last several years at my local elementary school. The camp covers all sorts of sports and games for kids in elementary school to let them try many different sports and see which ones might stick.

This year, we've started an inclusion program for kids on the spectrum, where ""inclusion specialists"" work at our camp specifically to look after those kids and help them through the camp if they need it. I've really enjoyed this program and nothing is better than watching a kid find a sport they enjoy or excel at.

Fast forward to this week, the third week we're holding the camp, and enter Connor and his mother Sara (fake names obv). Connor is 10, on the older side for this camp, and when we first met him in the morning, he seemed like a pretty good kid to work with at a camp. The problem was his mother.

She pulled me aside before the day started to specifically tell me about what Connor needed. Turns out, Connor had pretty severe meltdowns and what triggered them was losing.

His mother asked me to make sure Connor never lost a game. This included his team never losing, letting him win all the races, making sure his team came first in the relays, never letting him get tagged in tag, and never letting him get eliminated in any sort of last-man-standing game. I told her on no uncertain terms that I couldn't control that, and that was unfair to the other kids if I told them to always let him win.

She was not happy about this and told me that they were trying to avoid meltdowns this week and that he was working on it, but losing was still incredibly emotional for him. I told her that she really shouldn’t have sent him to a sports camp if she thought it would put him in distress or force all the other kids to cater to him. She asked me what the hell the inclusion program was for, and I told her it meant I as a coach could help him and his inclusion specialist could help him, but the other kids weren’t a part of this inclusion program.

She left very angry, but left Connor with us for the day, during which he had two meltdowns that the inclusion specialist dealt with, but I started feeling guilty. The whole point of the program was to allow kids like him to participate, but I didn’t want to sacrifice the other kids' experience just for him. So, AITA?

Edit: Thank you so much for your interactions, but here's a few quick details that I think got lost along the way! 1) This is not just a camp for neurodivergent kids, we brought a program in to integrate those kids in with the neurotypical kids. Over the past three weeks, there's been about a 10:1 ratio of neurotypical to neurodivergent. 2) This is a pretty small camp (20-30 kids max) and my neighbor used to run this camp when I was in high school, but when I graduated he handed a lot of it over to me. He now runs the financial, location, marketing, and legal stuff while I organize most of the camp itself along with a few other coaches, 2 of whom are still in high school, 2 in college. There isn't really a supervisor or higher up I can hand the mother over to except for the inclusion specialist. Hope this helps!

Edit 2 (sorry!): I don't hire the inclusion specialists, nor do I know exactly what they're qualified with, but they are working through a separate program outside our camp that we partnered with. They match the neurodivergent kids 1:1, and they are provided with all the information with the kids including lists of trigger and what calms them down. They are all qualified adults (real adults not college students and high schoolers like the coaches) and as far as I could tell they handled Connor's meltdowns with a lot of patience and expertise and got him back to playing with the other kids within a half-hour or so after each inciting incident. When I originally told Sara that the camp was likely not a good fit for Connor, I was more thinking about how the kid would be miserable in a cycle of meltdowns all day, and not about the qualifications of the inclusion program.

UPDATE! Thank you so much to everyone for your advice, comments, anecdotes, and support, I really appreciated it. Good news! Connor came back today, this time with his dad, who didn’t offer any sort of complaints or comments about yesterday to me or the inclusion therapist. From the two days and now five meltdowns (all lasting under an hour each) we’ve had with Connor, I believe either his mother underestimated his emotional regulation and ability to move on from losses, or the inclusion specialist was able to curb and limit his meltdowns better than she did at home. We tried to mitigate the situations where he would lose (for example we didn’t keep score during the large matches) but elimination games caused the meltdowns. For the record, he didn’t meltdown EVERY time he was eliminated or tagged, and he really wanted to participate in those games with the other kids, which is why we didn’t pull him from them. 

 I also want to explain why I originally thought the camp wouldn’t be a good space for Connor, and how I was proven wrong. I’ve always seen the camp as a place for kids to have fun and try new things, and I didn’t consider its value as a space for learning to manage triggers and work through emotions since we just introduced this program this year. From the way Sara described Connor’s emotional state, I heard about a kid who would likely hate most parts of the camp we ran, and would be very unhappy for seven hours a day for a week. While I understand the value of working through those upsetting emotions, the camp I run is meant to be fun, not stressful, or akin to a therapy session.

 I felt this way because I grew up with pretty severe anxiety related to school and I would have panic attacks before tests, so trying to imagine my parents sending me to a “Big Test Camp” for some exposure therapy during my summer break sounded horrible. Ignoring any sort of disability, competitive sports don’t mesh well with certain personalities. While they have always been a great outlet for me, I see kids all the time who really don’t enjoy how competition makes them feel emotionally or physically but are pushed into them by overbearing parents trying to relive their glory days. 

Ultimately, once I explained to Sara that I wasn’t going to rig the games, I understand now how saying he shouldn’t be at the camp had the wrong connotation, but I wanted the kid to have fun, and I didn’t want to place him in a position he couldn’t do that. Ultimately, I was wrong, and even with the meltdowns he’s had, I think the inclusion specialists are really helping him and I still agree with most of you that Sara was unreasonable. However, I also do stand by the fact that if Connor was as volatile and emotional when he lost as his mother made him seem, I don’t think the camp would have been a good place for him YET. Turns out, it was, and I’m glad Sara left him with us.

My sister (25F) has a 4 year. The baby daddy is the run of the mill deadbeat. Does not work, avoids court appearances, lives with his mother, does not even have a state ID. 

I have been support my sister for 3 years, she was staying with our mom but something happened to her and she now lives in a retirement community so she does not have the same amount of space. 

My mom asked me to make sure my sister is okay she is the baby. I get it she was young and the father of her child played a good act. I do not blame her for that.

So I cover childcare, and rent for my sister. I will spot her when she needs other stuff like school supplies, food, clothes for my niece. She is a manager at Target. 

When she has to work late I will let my niece sleepover. I generally had pick ups because I get off at 5. She generally handles drop offs. I will take care of dinner and my sister handles bath and bed time. 

My mom recently let the cat out the bag that my sister is going to Europe on the 12th to the 17th. My sister told me she was going to FL for her HS friends wedding. She asked if I would be willing to handle watching my niece. I said sure because she has been working late putting in long hours at work. 

I pushed our mom and got the truth. She is seeing someone, has not told them she has a kid. He thinks my niece is my child and she helps me out from time to time. He has met my mom, she seems to like him. 

After I found out I confronted my sister, she apologized. I told her I don't care she has until January. She told me I was being cold and misogynistic. Since I told her if she wants to date as a single mother you have an obligation to be transparent with the people you are dating that you have a child. 

She said she can separate the two, and I told her no she cannot. She has a daughter you cannot lie and say she is my kid so you can have fun and not scare people off. I don't understand the dating scene, having a kid at 21 with another man that is not in the picture is a huge red flag. I told her so is lying about having a kid. 

This does not work either way. I asked does she plan to pretend her daughter is mine forever? She said I am like a father to my niece anyways. 

Am I the asshole here? I know this may get harder for my sister especially my niece without my support she cannot afford where she lives, she cannot afford daycare on Targets pay. My mom has told me I do what is best for my niece. She is afraid if she push my sister too much she will break down.

I knew she was about an hour away, so I told her I had a surprise waiting for her when she got home.

To keep the food fresh, I put her burger in the fridge and the Frosty in the freezer. I even ordered the burger without lettuce, thinking I could avoid it getting soggy, and we have lettuce at home that we could add fresh.

When she got home, she was excited about the Frosty and asked, ""Is there a Krabby Patty burger too?"" I told her to check the fridge, and that’s when things went downhill. She got upset because the burger was cold and I didn’t get fries. She said that real ""justice"" would have been me waiting for her to come home so we could both get fresh food together, or at least putting my food in the fridge too, so we’d both be eating cold food.

She accused me of always expecting grand thanks for doing gestures that aren’t as big as I think they are and said I didn’t listen to her, since she wanted the full meal, not just the burger and Frosty. She also said she’s not going to pretend to be grateful for something that wasn’t what she asked for.

I was just trying to do something nice, and now I feel like my gesture was totally unappreciated. AITA?


Update: so we talked about it and I explained that I didn't have a problem if she would have said, I appreciate the gesture but I would have liked to get it together or if we would have waited until she was home.

 I told her I understood why she was upset and we both agreed that there was a better way to talk about it. 

She took a bite just now and said ""this is just a Dave's single with fancy sauce,"" so she doesn't even want it anymore hot or cold.

My (25 F) fiancé and I (22 F) are getting married in October. My future MIL is a plant freak and their entire property looks like something out of a garden magazine. Cobblestone paths, fountains, statues, shaped bushes and some of the most beautiful plants and trees I’ve ever seen. Including willow and cherry blossom trees. 

We’re getting married in the middle of a meadow towards the center of their property and it’s going to be gorgeous. My brother Justin has been dating Sarah for six years and they got engaged a few months ago. I’m not close with Sarah because they live across the state and only come down here for holidays and events. 

Sarah uses a prosthetic leg and apparently lately it’s been getting to be too much for her so she’s been using a wheelchair. He texted me asking if the property was wheelchair accessible and d I said I didn’t know and would let him know what I found out. There aren’t any stairs but the property has different sections with grass, cobblestone, gravel, and dirt and since I don’t use a wheelchair i don’t know how well they are at getting around in terrain like that. 

We went over to my in-laws to go over the ceremony and reception space and see how difficult it might be for Sarah. I texted my brother to let him know about the terrain. He asked if the reception was in the house and I said no, we were having a tent set up. He asked if we were putting that party tent flooring down and I said no. We looked in to it but it was out of our budget and everything will look nicer in the grass anyways. 

He asked if we would have one set up anyways because the grass would be too hard for Sarah to wheel over and I apologized and told him it was out of our budget by thousands. He told me that if we wouldn’t do that Sarah couldn’t come and we’d be excluding her. I said that it was unfortunate and if that was the case we’d miss her at our wedding. He called me ableist and discriminatory and said that if we wouldn’t accommodate her then he wouldn’t come to our wedding either. 

Not even a goddam hour later I got a text from my mom saying that I was being mean to my brother and Sarah and that it wouldn’t be a good look for me if I “decided not to do such a simple thing”. She told me that I could handle renting one of those tent patios since we didn’t pay for a venue and DIYd a lot of our wedding. 

I said I was sorry and gave my reasoning again. She told me that if we excluded Sarah they’d pull their contribution to our wedding. I’m not sure how exactly since they paid for our dresses and those were paid for weeks ago. I told her that if her and my brother wanted to foot the but that I’d be more than happy to speak to my MIL about having one put down. She said no. Her and dad are retired and Justin has his own wedding to pay for. 

I feel bad for excluding Sarah but I’m not sure what else I can do. AITAH? 

Edit to add info. Sarah has used a prosthetic since she’s been with my brother BUT this is the first and only time they’ve mentioned her being in a wheelchair. We sent out save the dates with my MILs address as the venue about 8 months ago and 2 months ago sent out formal invitations with more information regarding her property (parking, outdoors, length of walk to ceremony etc) and I hadn’t heard anything from my brother or Sarah besides a returned rsvp for yes. 

Edit 2. The quotes we were given for something that we were sure wouldn’t harm my MILS lawn was about $6,000 to $9,000 to rent for the evening. Our budget was $15,000 and we are already at the top end of it. 

Edit 3. The reason I didn’t suggest or look into a different kind of chair or scooter was because I just figured that that was something Sarah and Justin would have looked into themselves since they were the ones needing it. I figured since they jumped right to a $9,000 solution at my pocket that the other options wouldn’t work for them and they were bringing up the last available option. Also my fiancés grandma is wheelchair bound as well but has been to my MILs house plenty of times and it hasn’t come up as an issue. 
And for everyone upset about us getting married in grass and that people will struggle with their heels, I said in my post that in our invitations we had information about my MILs property. I’m sure people will dress accordingly considering they’re aware of the venue. Not sure why people are mad about that.","AITAH for not having a wheelchair accessible wedding? Throw away for privacy. My (25 F) fiancé and I (22 F) are getting married in October. My future MIL is a plant freak and their entire property looks like something out of a garden magazine. Cobblestone paths, fountains, statues, shaped bushes and some of the most beautiful plants and trees I’ve ever seen. Including willow and cherry blossom trees. 

We’re getting married in the middle of a meadow towards the center of their property and it’s going to be gorgeous. My brother Justin has been dating Sarah for six years and they got engaged a few months ago. I’m not close with Sarah because they live across the state and only come down here for holidays and events. 

Sarah uses a prosthetic leg and apparently lately it’s been getting to be too much for her so she’s been using a wheelchair. He texted me asking if the property was wheelchair accessible and d I said I didn’t know and would let him know what I found out. There aren’t any stairs but the property has different sections with grass, cobblestone, gravel, and dirt and since I don’t use a wheelchair i don’t know how well they are at getting around in terrain like that. 

We went over to my in-laws to go over the ceremony and reception space and see how difficult it might be for Sarah. I texted my brother to let him know about the terrain. He asked if the reception was in the house and I said no, we were having a tent set up. He asked if we were putting that party tent flooring down and I said no. We looked in to it but it was out of our budget and everything will look nicer in the grass anyways. 

He asked if we would have one set up anyways because the grass would be too hard for Sarah to wheel over and I apologized and told him it was out of our budget by thousands.

When I 25F was 9, my parents adopted my sister “Jen” who was 7 at the time. Jen was thin and fearful due to being neglected. We did everything to make her feel loved. We bought her lots of toys. Everything Jen wanted, she got. When my parents asked me to move to the smaller bedroom so Jen could have my room, I was happy to. When they asked if I would let Jen pick the decorations and cake for my upcoming birthday, I agreed. I was so happy to have a sister, and I understood why my parents gave her special treatment.

Only the treatment didn’t stop. For years, every trip we went on, we had to do what Jen wanted to do. We had to eat where she wanted to eat. And she got to plan all MY birthday parties. If she didn’t get what she wanted, she threw a tantrum. I still felt loved and cared for by my parents–they drove me to practices, bought me things, cooked meals for me, spent quality time and gave me advice, but I was always second to Jen.

As I got older, I did anything I could to leave the house. I got my first job when I was 12. I vacationed with friends instead of family. I played three different sports and did band. I took my driver’s test the DAY I turned 16 and bought a car the day after. I went to college on the other side of the country.

Now that I make good money, I do things I missed as a child. I take fancy vacations and throw elaborate parties as I please. My wedding was no exception. My fiancée “Kip” and I wanted everything to be perfect. We thought it would be fun to have a color scheme. My favorite color is yellow, and his is blue, so my guests would wear yellow, his would wear blue, and mutual friends would wear green. I picked out a dress with green embroidered details, and he picked a boutonniere with green flowers.

When Jen found out about this, she was mad. I didn’t know this, but she hates yellow and it “washes her out.” She told me under no circumstances would she wear yellow. I shrugged and said that was fine–I would just kick her out if she did not wear yellow.

There was no further discussion, but on my wedding day Jen came in a purple dress. I told her to leave immediately. The color scheme was perfect and she ruined it. Jen refused to leave until I threatened to call security.

The rest of the wedding went smoothly, but afterwards my parents were furious with me for kicking Jen out. I told them that I warned her she would be kicked out if she didn’t follow the color scheme, but they said they all thought it was a joke. They said it was cruel of me to kick my sister out over something so trivial. I told them this was MY wedding that I threw without their support, so I can kick out whoever I want to. Kip came rushing to defend me and even told my parents they should be ashamed of how they treated me, but over the past few days, a lot of people I’ve talked to–grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, have been mixed. Some say they wouldn’t have even invited Jen if they were me, while others think I should have let it slide. AITA?

Edit: (contest mode is over and I can finally edit) I want to make a few things clear. 1-I figured people would assume this, but I did NOT ask my guests to dress head to toe in their assigned color. I completely understand that people might not have yellow formalwear laying around. I said to dress in only neutral colors and/or your assigned color, so someone could wear a black dress and yellow jewelry, a blacks suit and a yellow tie, etc, but no colors outside neutral or your assigned color. 3-I invited Jen because she is family, and I honestly thought she was more mature than this. I did not know she hated the color yellow when I chose the color scheme.

Update: First, thanks for all of your comments. I felt so guilty the past few days and was worried it would carry into my honeymoon, but you have helped me realize that I am not the bad guy and it is okay that I responded the way I did.

Last night my parents reached out to me and asked if all the things Kip said–about how they should be ashamed–were true. At that point I told them how my upbringing had impacted me, and how my wedding was supposed to make up for the parties I never had as a kid, the decisions I never got to make. For the first time, I was able to call all of the shots and make everything exactly the way I wanted it to be. I even showed them this post and how most of you responded to help reinforce what I said. My parents said they had absolutely no idea how deeply their treatment had affected me. This is somewhat fair because I never really talked to them about it, but at the same time, I feel like they should have wondered why I left home as soon as I could, never came back, and hardly ever texted/called them. They said they feel so sorry about it, and are now planning a vacation with them, myself, and Kip for next summer to make up for it. I’m trying not to get my hopes up, but at least now it looks like they’re making an effort.

As for Jen, according to my parents she really struggled to make friends in middle school and high school. I didn’t know this because I practically lived with my high school bf my sophomore/junior year of high school and then graduated early, and Jen repeated a year in elementary school due to trauma so we were 5 grades apart despite only being 2.5 years apart. My parents tried putting her in therapy, but she wouldn’t cooperate. College was a slap in the face for her when she realized the world didn’t revolve around her–she had to live in the same 7x9’ room with plaster walls and linoleum floors as everyone else. She dropped out after a year and tried getting a job, but got fired after a few months. At that point my parents realized they really f\*cked up. They told Jen she had to either go to intensive therapy or they would kick her out. According to my parents, she’s now taking classes at a community college and hoping to transfer to a four year institution. She’s doing better for the most part, though she occasionally lashes out.

I’m glad Jen is getting the help she needs and working towards a career, and excited about potentially going on a trip with my parents and husband (while also knowing they might bail). I’m open to having more of a relationship with them, but I don’t think we’ll ever be a super tight knit family. Some wounds are too deep. But instead of dwelling on the past, I’m looking towards my future–starting a family with Kip, and making sure I don’t make the same mistakes my parents did.","AITA for kicking my sister out of my wedding because she did not follow the color scheme?\*\*Update at the end

But the seats are fantastic - just at the end of the catwalk 7 rows back or something. I have been a huge Taylor Swift fan for a very long time, and I felt like I hit the jackpot when she sold me my ticket because I know how disgustingly overpriced tickets are currently reselling for, especially for her North America shows.

Before Emily sold me the ticket she had it up for sale on Stub Hub for $2700, but nobody bought it. I knew this when buying the ticket and assumed that once I bought the ticket, she’d take it down. A few weeks ago when I saw Emily in the office, she told me that she had forgotten to take the ticket off of Stub Hub when I bought it, and someone else bought it earlier that week. I didn’t think too much of it because I figured that she’d have to just contact Stub Hub to explain that she didn’t have the ticket anymore and that would be that. 

Today, I got a DM from Emily telling me that I need to send the ticket back to her. Apparently, Stub Hub has a policy where if someone sells a ticket they don’t have, they’re on the hook to pay for a similar replacement ticket for the buyer at an equal or greater amount than the price it originally sold for. This means that she’d likely have to pay $2700 or more to Stub Hub for her mistake. She was apologetic, but I am devastated. I’ve grown up listening to Taylor and I am such a huge fan. Going to this concert truly meant so much to me, and I can’t afford to see her anywhere else other than my City. I am so so so sad.

I haven’t answered Emily’s message yet. She has offered to give me half of the sale profit for sending her the ticket back so I can maybe find another ticket, but here is where i may be the asshole. I want to ask her for all of the profit so I can at least have a fighting chance at a nosebleed seat or something. I don’t think it’s right for her to fuck up the way she has and still make a profit from this. So Reddit, WIBTA for saying that the only way I’m sending back the ticket is if I get the full profit from the sale? ","WIBTA if I refused to to return a Taylor Swift ticket that Stub Hub is demanding back from my co-worker?Hey reddit!

A few years ago I married again. Lisa decided to not attend my wedding and she said a bunch of hurtful things to my then fiancée Rosemary (38f). Since then, our relationship got even worse. When Rosemary and I welcomed our son a year and a half ago, Lisa sent me a text saying that since I have my perfect baby now, I could stop pestering her and trying to play family with her. It hurt me deeply, and I ended up distancing myself from her, though I kept sending her $100 a month as her allowance.

Recently we had an unplanned addition to our family. Long story short, Rosemary’s sister, who wasn’t a good parent to start with, terminated her custody rights over her son Blake (17m). Rosemary and I decided to take Blake in.

Unfortunately a few years ago Blake got in a horrible car wreck that left him permanently disabled. Luckily he can somewhat walk and doesn’t need 24/7 assistance around the house, but that’s about it. Blake is an amazing person and he quickly became a part of our family.

I explained that now when my family had expanded, I’m not having enough money. I’ll be still sending her mom the child support payments as per court agreement, but she shouldn’t expect anything extra. She asked me about the car since she knew about my plans on giving her a car. I told her that now the situation changed and I no longer could give her a car. I’ll admit, what I said next was probably assholish of me, since I told her that I now have two children to play family with and asked her to stop pestering me. 

This caused her to blow up completely to the point she got her mom to call me and scream at me, and so did her new husband. They threatened to sue me, Lisa said she’ll go no contact and so on.

My wife (27F) and I (28M) recently got married and it was amazing. The wedding was set on a riverside farm and so we had photoshoots outside on the fields before the ceremony. We started taking photos around noon and my sister-in-law (30F) was one of the bridesmaids. SIL has always been a negative person since I met her, always trying to make small judgemental comments, while my wife is an incredibly kind person. They have very different personalities, so I never questioned why they aren't close and assumed that SIL was included in her group of bridesmaids to appease my wife's parents.   
  
Because SIL and my wife have never been very close, she was at the end of the line of bridesmaids and usually was at the edges of group photos. While taking the photos, SIL was the only person complaining about things like the sunny weather and how her dress was ""absorbing heat."" I don't know much about dresses but it was about 70°F. Most people in the photoshoot group ignored her comments and it wasn't an issue for the rest of the day.  
  
We got the photos of both the shoot and the ceremony from the photographer 3 weeks after the wedding. We promptly sent the photos to the people in photoshoot and told them we planned on using the photos on social media. Most people thanked us for the photos but my SIL called my wife and was very angry, yelling that she ""looked like a fat pig"" in every photo she was in and demanded that we not use any of the photos with her in them. For context, SIL is bigger than my wife but not to an extreme extent. She doesn't look unhealthy and I've never heard her have body issues before but I admittedly wouldn't know much about it. In the wedding photos, she really doesn't look any different from her normal self.  
  
My wife tried to reason with her, saying she looks just as pretty as everyone else but SIL did not want to hear it. She reiterated that if we used any photo of her on social media that she would never speak to us again and would ""put us on blast"" whatever that means. My wife was really hurt by her sister's outburst and I was very bothered that she thought she could tell us what to do with our special moment.  
  
Here's where I may be the asshole: I decided that if she had such a problem, she didn't need to be in the photos. I cropped her out and posted those versions to social media. I thought it would be fine and it was easy since she was at the edge anyway. After posting, she then called me even angrier than before and accused me of trying to ""erase her from the memory of the wedding."" I told her I only did it to accomodate her wishes while also getting to use our own wedding photos. SIL hasn't talked to us in a week, my wife's parents are mad at us for upsetting SIL. While my wife is on my side, she thinks I could have been more mature about it. I don't think I did anything wrong and accommodated her already unreasonable request.

My wife tried to reason with her, saying she looks just as pretty as everyone else but SIL did not want to hear it. She reiterated that if we used any photo of her on social media that she would never speak to us again and would ""put us on blast"" whatever that means. My wife was really hurt by her sister's outburst and I was very bothered that she thought she could tell us what to do with our special moment.  
  
Here's where I may be the asshole: I decided that if she had such a problem, she didn't need to be in the photos. I cropped her out and posted those versions to social media. I thought it would be fine and it was easy since she was at the edge anyway. After posting, she then called me even angrier than before and accused me of trying to ""erase her from the memory of the wedding."" I told her I only did it to accomodate her wishes while also getting to use our own wedding photos. SIL hasn't talked to us in a week, my wife's parents are mad at us for upsetting SIL. While my wife is on my side, she thinks I could have been more mature about it. I don't think I did anything wrong and accommodated her already unreasonable request.
