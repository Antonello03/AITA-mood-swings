   I've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. You can skip to the TL;DR if the exposition is too long.

She's a self-proclaimed ""foodie"", which I honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. She can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. 

If you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' When someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.

(It doesn't stop there, she knew I had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as I walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. It's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)

That's not it, either. She *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, BAM, I'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. 

It's gotten to the point where I don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. Even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, I've saved up more being with her than I ever had in any other relationship. The only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.

Our anniversary was recently, and I had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so I suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, ""I'm not learning how to make sushi because then I'll *never* get a real date ever again."" We ended up going out instead.

It kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. She's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like Olive Garden ""because she likes the red sauce"" or other places because she likes the food, and now that I'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because I've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.

She also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste I've ever seen so I kinda think it's just an excuse.

I just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.

TL;DR: So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because I practically have a private chef of my very own?

Edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, I just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.

Edit 2: I'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. I'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of Twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick

Edit3: no, twitter, I don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. I buy her herbs and succulents. What flowers do I buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?

Also, yes, I wash the dishes

#Final Edit:

Okay guys. This will probably be my last edit. This post exploded unexpectedly and I've tried to respond to as many comments as I can, but there's just too many of you. If you've asked me a direct question and I haven't answered, I'm sorry. My inbox is a mess.

I really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and I can honestly say that I've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. It's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.

So her mom picked up the girls and I took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. She was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and I apologized for being stupid. After, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so I asked her to marry me.

She said no. She did it kindly, but she still said no. She said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. 

I'm pretty heartbroken. I thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.

So, Reddit, you were all right. I'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.

My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. 

&#x200B;

A little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200B;

Well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to ""think of them"". I told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200B;

Well, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to Disneyland"". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200B;

I'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"".

I specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat — just the aisle and window. 

Well, a very obese man boards and I can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. I assume maybe he bought two hence why he’s even attempting to board. I’m mentally crossing my fingers he’s not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. 

I get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. Well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. After a minute, I decided to be upfront and tell him:

“Sir, I’m sorry but this situation is not working for me, you’re taking up quite a bit of my seat”. 

He wasn’t rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there’s not nothing he can do — although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. It just wasn’t enough, though. He still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. I’m talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. 

I end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. She instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. She goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren’t any open seats on this flight, so there wasn’t a way to move people so he could have two. This causes a very awkward silence. 

The guy seemed embarrassed and didn’t want to get up. He mentioned how he can’t wait for a later flight. I felt bad for him but I was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight — the comfort I paid for. The flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he’ll need to book another flight. The guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here’s where I made my offer. 

I told the guy, “Look, I’ll put up with this if you give me $150 — that’s half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.”

He instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. He even told me he appreciated it. 

Well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn’t volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. I just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. 

From my perspective, I gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and I was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person’s body pressed against you involuntarily). A win-win. He wasn’t angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately.

I got married last Saturday. Hooray for me! My sister was my maid of honor. During her speech, she brought up her depression and how my husband supported her through it and how “in that moment, I knew he was the one for throwaway...” (so cliche!).

I’m also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so I’ll try to keep it as PG as I can.

So, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
I will say that she’s the first thin person I’ve ever been with. She’s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I’ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I’ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
This all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She’s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she’s not attractive if she doesn’t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.
I told her I had to be honest, and said that I’m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b-bs. It’s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I’m being honest, that’s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
She was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we’ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn’t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).

Am I being the asshole here?

They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.

The mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.

Regardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.

Thing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.

I absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.

My wife and I struggle to make ends meet. We strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. This includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. 

Recently our DD dropped the milk and spilled it. It was 5 days to payday and we’d already done our grocery shopping. My wife said she’d figure it out. I know she has a little money stashed for herself that she’s gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, I figured she must have decided to dip into that. Boy was I wrong. 

The next week I noticed our food was a little...higher quality. A couple of brand name things, even a roast on Sunday with asparagus. I figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when I asked she said “oh no, I found a bunch of money off coupons.” Then she showed a few to me. 

They were those “Earn 0.07$ a gallon” receipts you get at the gas station. She had gone there and dug through the garbage! She said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. 

I was speechless. I asked her how she could lower herself like that. She replied that she did it for our kids. When I asked why she didn’t use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. 

I’m so disgusted guys. I can’t believe she did this. I don’t even want to look at her. She on the other hand is mad at me, and says I’m an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. AITA for expecting my wife NOT to dumpster dive?

Edit: OK! I am definitely the asshole. After reading all of your comments, I really thought about it. I talked to my wife, and told her I was sorry for the way I acted. She is annoyed but willing to forgive me. I was actually mad at myself. The reason we are struggling is because I was in an accident a few months ago. I slid through a stop light on an icy road. It has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade I’ve worked in for 15 years. I’m on disability through my employer but it isn’t even half of what I used to make. We are getting by, but it is tight. And I don’t know what we are going to do when it runs out. My wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). I guess I was just mad at myself because I can’t take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. I’m going to give her a foot rub tonight. Thanks for the honesty guys.

She always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.

So we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).

I have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.

I had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.

So I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. 

She keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. 

The guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. 

So the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.

I then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?

**To those saying that the other flatmates are all guys, that's NOT true. Aside from the bitch, there are two girls, and the rest guy.**

**To the people telling me that I should have spoken nicely to her, I SAID IN THE FIRST FEW PARAGRAPHS I ALREADY DID THIS.

She was in her mid 20s at the time. I was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. She on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage. 

So when I meet her we click instantly and I fall head over heels for her. We get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. When we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. Obviously I was jealous but I went along with it since it seemed logical.

So she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while I work 12 hour days and then some. I’m not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.

A couple years ago I discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend’s husband. Divorced obviously followed.

The only major asset we had in the US was our house, which was a premarital asset. We had a shared bank account, but since I am a finance guy I handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. 

Now if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, I’d have no problem paying what’s fair. But the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent. 

So in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.

So here I am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. So I sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it’s taking so long to liquidate our savings. Once abroad I immediately stop alimony payments.

Now she has no legal recourse (I’ve double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.

The reason I’m asking here is that my own children are split on this. My son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side.

Their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son’s main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge.

I couldn’t leave, and he wasn’t calm for hours. I’d left my daughter a voicemail saying I wasn’t going to be able to make it. 

She called back that night absolutely livid. She called me a shitty mother, said I had two kids but only cared about one, that I’d missed every game and performance she’d had as a child and it clearly wasn’t going to change as adults and that she was just done. She said she knows he can’t help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. She hung up and that was it.

We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

I told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.

AITA?

She recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest.

Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.

I message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little ""break"" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.

I ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt.

She's beautiful. She works as a professional model. Not like an Instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything.

She also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. She usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. For some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. She only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor.

So the other day I was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. I said ""Thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model"" and she shot me this dirty look. Later she said I was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and I had no right to correct her. That what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. That her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.

I dont see what the big deal is so AITA here for telling people what she really does for money?

\*\*Edit just to clarify I she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. I just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after I did it. Also I was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when I introduced her to my friends.

\*\*Edit 2 Theres so many comments and I am trying to read them all. I do respect her. I do love her for more then her beauty. Shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. She's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. Honestly I am blown away with how pretty she is and I've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. So that part does excite me.

I genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think I am the asshole for this I do value how much money a field brings in. When I chose my area in college I did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. I am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and I am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. I'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.

I shot an apology text (We're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her Dojo. She said we can talk after work and I offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.

&#x200B;

\*\*Final Edit

At this point I imagine no one is reading anymore I asked the mods if I should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.

I was really bothered by the things people said. Not because I wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. I didn't want to be the guy everyone said I was. I really didn't.

&#x200B;

First I want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. Yes I knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. We have been dating for around 3-4 months.

&#x200B;

Next I want to say She was meeting some of my good friends. I was not trying to ""show her off"" in that she was a trophy for me. I was trying to point out her accomplishments. I thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. I can see where I was wrong. I did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and I felt it was more glamorous. I am an asshole for that. I did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and I'm also the asshole for that too. I wont deny it. But I DONT just see her as a trophy. I do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because I learned something really really important.

&#x200B;

After this thread blew up like it did and I had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick I was I knew I was dead wrong and had fucked up. I texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. I asked her if we could talk about it and I could try and make it up to her. She agreed. I told her I wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if I could sit in on some of her classes. She said she would like that. I made it top priority. I left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.

&#x200B;

What I saw really opened my eyes to be honest. I watched two classes and took part in the second one. The first one was her with a kids after school class. She was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. Someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. Thats dead wrong. It must be much harder to teach kids and I think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. I saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she DOES want to be a mom one day).

&#x200B;

The second class was a womens self defense class. I took part in this one as ""the bad guy"" and I was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. I got manhandled by about 15 women. We had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. For those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)

&#x200B;

I definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. She taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. Most importantly I saw the qualities beyond her appearance that I love most about her really shine. I realized the things I love most about her; Her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. This is really the part of her I love. It doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. I also saw how much she loved what she was doing. I saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. I'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong I was.

&#x200B;

I told her this when I went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. She also filled me on the modeling thing. She doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out

&#x200B;

First off its not as glamours as I thought it was

&#x200B;

She said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model

&#x200B;

She works as a model because of a few accidents. She was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. Thats all it took for her to be a model. It took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. She started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. She feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. She said being called a ""Model"" defines her by her appearance defines her by WHAT she is and not WHO she is. She doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. She doesn't feel that being a ""model"" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.

&#x200B;

She doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. That she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. She doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. She feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. She wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.

&#x200B;

This is where I lit up and felt I had something to really offer her. I work in finance. Go ahead hate me but I DO like money. I like to have it, I like to make it, I like the freedom it affords and I like to watch it flow and grow. So I offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. I thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what I know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. We both win. She agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and I will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.

&#x200B;

Finally I asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.

&#x200B;

I know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. I learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. In the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why I love her. So honestly thank you AITA yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but I needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. Is she the better person? Yes she is. Do I deserve her. No I dont, But I am going to do better.

We were at a local restaurant last Saturday evening. This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

But as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own.

This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

But as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own.

In the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. She was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. The wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. I thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. She didn't tell the couple tho. Just complained about it to us behind their backs. 

We traveled 600 miles to the wedding. We treated the trip like a vacation. Spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. 

The day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. Not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. I hate dressing up so I was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. 

My husband and I had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. A few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. Immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. I wore a hoodie, daisy Duke shorts and cute sandals. 

I noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but I figured they didn't get the memo. The bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which I thought was weird for a casual wedding. The reception was awesome. Nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. We had a blast. 

So we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. They thought it was very disrespectful. Apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. This explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. 

TBH we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. And they never specified the dress code in the invitation.

**EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed...

Last night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

Well to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

I offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

I woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

Was I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

To answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn’t a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it’s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don’t get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.","AITA because I ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?What I thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and I'm up at 7:05 AM dealing with it. I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. 

I'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough.

I look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I’ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

So anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it’s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad.

So today I took my baby over to my parents’ house for dinner, without my wife. We have a five month old, she’s home with the kid all day while I’m at work and needed a break—so I went with the baby. Works out well for everyone because she can nap, my parents get to spend time with their granddaughter, and I bring her home a doggie bag with dinner.

On the way home, around 10pm, I made a left in a no left. It saves me about 10 minutes because otherwise you have to go all the way around this huge park and then there are a bunch of one-way streets. It’s a no left there because in rush hour it gets clogged up, but this was late at night and the street was pretty quiet: turning left did not worsen traffic or put anyone in any danger.

Of course there is a cop lurking and waiting, and I get pulled over. Here in Ontario, ‘disobey a sign’ is a $100 fine and 2 demerits (guess how I know…).

Baby was sleeping in her car seat in the back. So just as the cop was about to leave her car to walk up to mine, I just for a second turned the radio on fairly loud and on a static channel. Baby woke up and starting screaming. When I rolled down the window, the cop heard a screaming baby and sent me on my way.

Baby was perfectly fine. I gave her the pacifier and as soon as the car started moving she fell back asleep. We’re home now and she’s asleep and perfectly fine in her crib. I felt kind of guilty about the whole situation so I moved $100 (what I would have paid for the ticket) into the kid’s RESP (university fund).

‘My wife was absolutely furious when she found out’ is what I might say if I was a complete idiot and had told her.

Throwaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad.

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she’s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of “it’s fine I have my dads credit card I’m not paying ” which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I’ve told my son multiple times he’s never allowed to use my card so I’m interested to see how this girl thinks she’s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can’t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn’t her card but her father’s and I’m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I’ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don’t think she was ever told no.

Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it’s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I’ve pointed out it wasn’t hers cashier tells her she can’t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it’s still fraud. Girl says it’s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she’s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me.

I am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when I asked to confirm the size of Bio Child, she asked me about Foster Child. I told her I didn't think to include her because she's Foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. She said all grandchildren should be included. My thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. That would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet. 

She went off on me and hung up and I am sitting here feeling horrible. I did not mean I do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but I thought I had a clear thought process? 

AITA?

Edit: I do care about this child, I'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. I just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still.

Final edit: I accept judgment and I commented on the person's comment that made me realize why I am in the wrong. They were to the point and just made it a simple question and I understood. 

I feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. I did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). Maybe I should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, I apologize. 

Accusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. I am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - I'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react. 

My daughter and I called her case manager and the photo idea including FC has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting FC or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait.

Thanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why I was in the wrong.

I told her I didn't think to include her because she's Foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. She said all grandchildren should be included. My thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. That would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet. 

She went off on me and hung up and I am sitting here feeling horrible. I did not mean I do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but I thought I had a clear thought process? 

AITA?

Edit: I do care about this child, I'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. I just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still.

Final edit: I accept judgment and I commented on the person's comment that made me realize why I am in the wrong. They were to the point and just made it a simple question and I understood. 

I feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. I did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). Maybe I should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, I apologize. 

Accusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. I am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - I'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react. 

My daughter and I called her case manager and the photo idea including FC has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting FC or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait.

Thanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why I was in the wrong.

Another edit: I accept judgment as I said about my actions... but I stand by my matching flannel idea.

She had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. She wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so I had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about ""needing privacy to pee"", I'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done.

When I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along.

When I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

We had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. 

Two weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! 

I asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. 

My wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

Like I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?

Edit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she’s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She’s always been awesome to me and she’s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the “mommy bailed you out” comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it’s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it’s not like I’m not paying for it on my own eventually.

Edit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?

Edit4: I’m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I’m still reading because honestly I’m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

Edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you’re a mod, do you know? I can’t respond to any posts and get the “status 403” whenever I try. Thanks!

Edit in the morning: I couldn’t figure out why I was getting so many private’s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn’t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I’ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I “had come to your senses” I don’t want to disappoint her.

I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

We had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. 

Two weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! 

I asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. 

My wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

Like I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?

Edit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she’s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She’s always been awesome to me and she’s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the “mommy bailed you out” comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it’s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it’s not like I’m not paying for it on my own eventually.

Edit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?

Edit4: I’m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I’m still reading because honestly I’m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

Edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you’re a mod, do you know? I can’t respond to any posts and get the “status 403” whenever I try. Thanks!

Edit in the morning: I couldn’t figure out why I was getting so many private’s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn’t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I’ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I “had come to your senses” I don’t want to disappoint her.

I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I’d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

Well a friend’s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I’d be happy to give him his quarters back if he’d asked but I’m not a casino and while I’m not destitute, I can’t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he’d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

Edit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because I've been banned.

Edit2: wow since I’m a “baby gangster” who has been running an “illegal gaming operation” (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I’m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

Edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

If the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I’ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the “winner” thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN’T be this dramatic in real life...I’m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I’m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don’t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don’t  in the process.

Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I’ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can’t “afford” to give it to him. 

Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that’s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You’d say yes. Now let’s say a guy you’ve never met says “hey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I’m taking the whole thing.” You would say no. It’s how I’ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I’ve given people quarters to play, I’ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I’ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That’s a nickel a day. that’s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


Edit5: a good question:

>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

Edit6: another good question

>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?


I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

Edit7: 

>INFO
We need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine

So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if I'm way off base.

Edit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried.

> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you’ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

Edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say ""your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?""  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.

Dialing my friend’s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she’s on tinder (she’s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said “none of your business” 

I decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she’s just swiping for fun?) so I didn’t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he’d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

I created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister’s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she’s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. 

I decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could “head to my place afterwards”. She was completely receptive and said she’d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

After she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for “Jim”. My dad went up to her and said “Jim’s not coming” and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age.

I told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a “fucking dick” and “cruel” to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who’s right and if I went too far?

Dialing my friend’s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she’s on tinder (she’s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said “none of your business” 

I decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she’s just swiping for fun?) so I didn’t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he’d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

I created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister’s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she’s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. 

I decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could “head to my place afterwards”. She was completely receptive and said she’d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

After she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for “Jim”. My dad went up to her and said “Jim’s not coming” and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger’s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out.

I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

Now, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

Liv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

Here's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
We both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

Their relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible. 

On an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.

When I playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago I was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. She said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. I told her that I got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that I also do to stay presentable. Her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. Now she's saying I have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which I find crazy as I'm not her sugar daddy. Why should I pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby?

I understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. I haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am I enforcing any ultimatums. If, as she says, I've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? Anyone who says I'm TA, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves.

**Gf's side:** He keeps being a dick about how long I would take in the bathroom, so as he said, I quit things he didn't even realize I was doing. No makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, I have curly frizzy hair so I stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. Do I look like a beast? Sure. Am I a comfy, smug beast? Hell yes.

He rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so I obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. I'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that I stopped, I feel like... why do I ever have to do all this shit. It's unfair. And if I have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. I conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. Conservatively. He should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. Otherwise it's not fair.

**Both:** We love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. We recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion.

**EDIT (from bf):** alright, I'm the asshole. You know, it wasn't even the people saying I *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying I wasn't. No way in hell do I want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think I'm not TA then I definitely am. My girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, ""in stained shirts and greasy hair"". Jesus. The amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that I'm not TA and the Reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man.

I think it's reasonable to say that I'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case I would either pay up or we break up. However, luckily, I am still very much into her. I would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and I think those who pointed out that I should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct.

My 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. 

My sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. 

Now, I completely understood this and I think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. I called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. My sister rolled her eyes and said 'Fine, I'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. I was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. I didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired.

So I left, and went for the bus. Literally five minutes later I get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the ER because she cracked her head open on the living room table. Apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head. 

I am absolutely raging at my sister. I don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. She argues that I 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which I feel I didn't. She says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but I feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.

AITA?","AITA for leaving my toddler with my 'childfree' sister for a few minutes, resulting in a trip to the emergency room?I (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that I can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter. 

My 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. 

My sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'.

So I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into.

After dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn’t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

Couple days ago me and my brother we’re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven’t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what’s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the “secrets” I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying “Just don’t let mom find out” The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out “I cheated on my wife...” At first it didn’t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife’s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They’ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) 
He told me life has been good to him now and he’s just thankful things have finally worked out.

I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid.

Fast forward to us getting these photos developed after the honeymoon. We look through them together for the first time- to summarise:

Her photos: Me in my suit, me with our God daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. More of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me.

My photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen.

As soon as Sarah saw the pictures I had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. I asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that I hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. I basically told her that I didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride.

Super bright, very loud, apparently VERY fragile and pretty much right out in the open. When I saw her touching it I told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. Now, I'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but I felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.

A so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. Now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding I pay her back for breaking ""art"" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). I'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people I know think I'm in the wrong here. I personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open. I also do not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was, I think there's a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them. Whose the asshole here?","AITA for refusing to pay for thousands for something my child broke?I live in a pretty small town, so if you don't know somebody directly, you're likely to know a person who knows them, and this is pretty much biting me in the ass right now.

We had a birthday party for her on Saturday. That morning was pretty hectic. I was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and I didn't notice.

All that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as ""Sarah"" and it's ""Sara"" and I said, ""who cares, just scrape off the H"" but she insisted on returning it. So I said ""fine whatever."" And then as she's leaving she says since I screwed up already I should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. 

And I go into the kitchen and I ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" She says ""the gift bags."" I found all the candy and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.

My wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive. The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until I got the box. She looked inside an was horrified

""What the fuck is this?"" she whispers. And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. I then I just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.

Well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.

well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? I tell her ""It's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags"" and damn it she freaked. She says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.

So yeah I've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. I told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said I was a huge asshole and she's mad that I dont think it's a big deal. and I still dont. Actually, I think I'm the one that should be mad at HER for keeping this going for almost a week.

So I said ""fine whatever."" And then as she's leaving she says since I screwed up already I should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. 

And I go into the kitchen and I ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" She says ""the gift bags."" I found all the candy and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.

My wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive. The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until I got the box. She looked inside an was horrified

""What the fuck is this?"" she whispers. And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. I then I just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.

Well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.

well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? I tell her ""It's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags"" and damn it she freaked. She says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.

So yeah I've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. I told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said I was a huge asshole and she's mad that I dont think it's a big deal. and I still dont. Actually, I think I'm the one that should be mad at HER for keeping this going for almost a week.

So, Reddit, AITA?

So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we’ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it’s become a great tradition in our social circle. 

Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now.

During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn’t push the issue. 

However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don’t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don’t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don’t believe it’s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners.

We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

So I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great.

This is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food.

I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

Overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

So, AITA?

EDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

EDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy.

I'm a nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad. 

Recently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. My ex agreed if there was a weekend trip I wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but I honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips. 

I was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. My sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. My SIL seemed to understand where I was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever I was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the NYC shopping trip I had planned for December and my son would happily join me for my Saturday morning spin classes. I considered that but my SIL loves taking her kids everywhere so I don't know that she is aware of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever you go.

I’m 23 and I got incredibly drunk at a party two weekends ago and ended up with alcohol poisoning. I do relatively drink a lot, but only in social settings. 

I spent the rest of weekend in the hospital recovering. It was a one time stupid mistake. 

Yesterday, I went over to my parent’s house for dinner. 

When I walked in, they were all sitting in the living room with somebody I’d never seen before.

I asked what was going on and my brother told me to sit down. I did and the man I didn’t know started talking. 

To summarize, he said that my family was worried for me and wanted me to go to treatment.

I got upset and said that everyone was being over dramatic and that this was ridiculous. I said that I realized that I had made a mistake drinking that much but this was overkill. I stood up and walked out at that point. 

My mom ran out after me with the interventionist and said that they only did this because they loved me. 

I said that everyone was acting crazy and I hopped in my car and went home. 

My brother has been texting me begging me to reconsider but I haven’t answered. 

Everyone is crazy overreacting. Getting that drunk is not a normal thing for me. It just happened once and I regret it. I have a good job and I look after myself. I don’t think I need rehab or that intervention. 

That said, maybe I did handle the intervention the wrong way. I maybe could’ve responded in a way that made them feel better instead of blowing up.

My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure as a husband and father, so what say you here?

THIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept.

INFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help. 

As for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her ""stuff"".  She already has ""stuff"".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with ""stuff"".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me.

Update for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die.

Update for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to ""retire"" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week ""preschool"" for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and ""bless"" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.

Lastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.  

I still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough.


UPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough ""things"" and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on ""giving"" generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a ""new tradition"" that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded.

To those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and ""not bothered to budget for it once it came"" are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.  We are taking steps to ensure that this kid will be our last, and I actually brought up abortion but my wife would not even consider it.

I've had full custody for the last three years and it's just the step mom and me now. Their mother is no longer in the picture.

They were so excited about christmas last year. There were many presents for them under the tree from the grand parents and us, and they were constantly checking them out trying to guess what was in them. 

They could hardly wait for Christmas day and begged us to let them open some presents early. So we allowed them to open one present that was gifted to both of them. It was the heaviest package under the tree and you could feel their excitement when I told them they could open it on Christmas eve. They tore into it like a couple savages. I'd wrapped it very well to make it take a little time to get at the goods.

Am I the asshole for wrapping a brick as a present?","AITA for wrapping a fake present for my kids?I have two sons from a previous marriage ages 8 and 9. I've had full custody for the last three years and it's just the step mom and me now. Their mother is no longer in the picture.

They were so excited about christmas last year. There were many presents for them under the tree from the grand parents and us, and they were constantly checking them out trying to guess what was in them. 

They could hardly wait for Christmas day and begged us to let them open some presents early. So we allowed them to open one present that was gifted to both of them. It was the heaviest package under the tree and you could feel their excitement when I told them they could open it on Christmas eve. They tore into it like a couple savages. I'd wrapped it very well to make it take a little time to get at the goods.

They have a maid who comes and tidies up for a bit every day. 

My family isn’t broke, but we’ve never had people working for us, and it made me super uncomfortable. Like, who am I to have someone serving me and cleaning around me while I sit there? I can’t imagine if my mom were witnessing that. She’d flip. 

So I got up and started to help her tidy up. She thanked me for the help and told me I really didn’t have to worry about it, but I told her it was no trouble (it really wasn’t, we were just sitting watching TV.) 

Later that night my girlfriend’s parents asked me not to help the maid clean because it was a boundary thing and her work was her work and guests are guests. I told them it made me really uncomfortable to have someone clean around me and they just said not to worry because she’s paid well and has been with them a long time. 

The next day it happened again and it made me so uncomfortable I said “hey let’s go outside” to my girlfriend but she was busy on her laptop. So eventually I couldn’t help it, I had to jump up and help her out. 

Her parents walked in and looked pissed and my girlfriend finally clued in and ushered me outside. 

I’m still so confused by the situation. I’m not sure if I was in the wrong for helping her clean or if I’m in the wrong now for not helping her. 

My instinct is to help, but when I do people get pissed, so, if you understand the dynamic better than me, please clear this up.

Me and my wife have two children (15F & 11M). My wife is a stay at home mom since the birth of our second child. I (46M) work full time and earn a six figure salary. My job is highly stressful, requires me to travel a lot and mostly sleep in hotels. I only get to come home to my family on every second weekend, on average. Despite working a lot, I am glad to do it so that my family can live a comfortable life.

Last year, I decided to buy my wife a Roomba for Christmas. My wife tends to be the one who vacuums the house so I presumed that she would like this present as it would free her of this chore.

As she unpacked the present, she was heavily offended and did not hesitate to show it, which made the whole situation quite uncomfortable as my parents and other members of the family were also present. She argued that 'this should not be a present directed at her but at the whole family, as it is the entire family’s responsibility to clean up the house'.

Since I work and am the sole source of income in the family and she is a stay at home mother, I think it is apparent that she should take on responsibilities such as taking care of the kids and maintaining the house. The gift was intended to somewhat relieve her of this burden. I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working. As cheesy as it sounds, I think that time is one of the most precious gifts and that Roomba would have definitely bought some time for her - time that she could use to do whatever she pleased instead of vacuuming. 

Unfortunately, one year later, this still often gets brought up during arguments, often coupled with her crying.

So, AITA in this situation?

EDIT: I should also add that I would have never gifted my wife a vacuum cleaner or anything along these lines. I saw the Roomba as a robot that would fully take over this task which is why I thought it was a good idea.

EDIT #2: I asked her numerous times before Christmas last year what she would have liked to receive and she repeatedly told me that she does not want anything. I was left to guess and chose the most practical gift that I was certain she could be able to make use of.","AITA for buying my wife a Roomba for Christmas?This happened last year but since it still gets brought up during arguments every now and then and I just discovered this Subreddit I decided to check what you guys think.

My daughter is seventeen years old. She turned seventeen in February. Since she was around ten, she has been complaining about her lips. She inherited her fathers thin lips. They are a great shape, but they are thin. She has been bullied for it for ages. She has come crying to me about it several times. I thought she would get over it as she got older, but she never has. 

My daughter lives with her father and step mother full time because I travel for work. But when I am in town, she tends to stay with me for weeks at a time. We are very close. Two weeks ago she confided in me that she had been saving money for lip injections for two years now. She had a lot of money saved up.

We had a heart to heart about it and I decided to go ahead and pay for her to get them from a good doctor. I signed the consent forms and we did it. She is very happy with them, she loves them. They have really balanced out her face. 

When it was time for me to leave for work again, I took her back to her father’s. He flipped it. He started yelling at both of us and claiming that we destroyed her face. I apologized to him for not clearing it with him, but it was because I knew that he would say no. This was something she has really wanted for a long time. He argues that she is a child and doesn’t know what she wants.

Of course he has spread the news of the lip injections to several family members. They think that it is shameful that I would take my daughter to get plastic surgery and are urging him to limit my visitation (probably not going to happen). I think that they just do not empathize with my daughter and are excited to shame me for letting her get the most minor plastic surgery.

This is my first year in college. Everything is working out fine EXCEPT for my roommate. Ever since I moved here I just can’t stand him. Why? I can write a whole story about why I despise this person but I don’t wanna keep this long so I will just mention the key points.

1. He is really messy. His room is a total mess (not that I sleep there but I don’t have TV in my room and sometimes have to go to his room for it. NOTE that we are paying equal rent so he isn’t doing me a favor for it).
2. He used to not even wash his plates until I told him I am not washing for him.
3. He would leave a mess everywhere until I had to explain to him like he is a little kid as to why it’s not good to have a dirty house.
4. Bathroom smells horrible whenever he leaves it. He can’t even clean the toilet after use.

Luckily though, I would rarely see him because I would spend most of my times at either the library, gym or with friends or my girlfriend after classes. Now though, because of what is happening, I must stay in the house which is killing me.

I now have to work out and study at home. I like to jump the rope as a cardio exercise for 10-15 minutes which can make some noise. 2 days ago, while I was exercising he told me to stop jumping rope and find something else because I make too much noise. I got so pissed off because I never complain when he does things that bother me but now he can’t even handle some noise for 10 minutes? I told him I won’t stop so he just went back to his room. Yesterday though when I wanted to work out again I couldn’t find my rope. I asked him if he has seen it and told me he HID IT from me and will give it back to me when he finishes studying as he can’t concentrate. I got so pissed off because again IT’S JUST 10-15 MINUTES, maybe 20 with breaks in between. I never complain when he bothers me but he can’t even handle this. Because of this, I hid his laptop when he was out today. While I was working out, he asked me if I had seen his laptop and I told him I will give it to him after I finish working out. He said he has an online exam tomorrow and that he needs it now to revise but I refused to give it. I’m physically stronger than him so he can’t do me anything either. He just went back to his room.

Well. When I finished working out he asked for the laptop back. I went outside to get it but I couldn’t find it anymore. I think someone must have stolen it. I told him I couldn’t find it and he told me that if I don’t give his laptop back today he will press charges on me but he has no proof so I doubt it will work. He is blaming me for stealing his laptop but I just hid it because he tried imposing restrictions on me. I didn’t know it will get stolen. Today I even caught him stalking me on social media. I called him out on this.

I have been dating an American girl (F24) for two years now. My girlfriend does not speak French at all. The actual events in question happened this winter.

I usually go to France around Christmas time. The most recent Christmas, my girlfriend wanted to come with me. I said sure as she had never been to France before and we'd been dating almost two years so it seemed reasonable. 

My family comes from the South West, but I also have family in Paris so we stopped in Paris first. My gf wanted to eat at a fancy French restaurant while we were there, something with Michelin stars. Expensive, but not really a problem since I make pretty good money.

We made a reservation for a good restaurant, not the best but still good. We had to make it months in advance because it's a restaurant that's high in demand. As a very upscale restaurant, there was also a dress code and things like that.

We showed up and everything was fine at first. They took our coats, we sat down, the restaurant was beautiful, etc. The waiter then gave us our menu. I had to do all the communication as my gf doesn't speak French.

I was showing my gf something on my menu and she noticed that mine had prices and hers didn't. I had completely forgotten about this tradition because it's just not common at all in the US.

She asked me why mine had prices but not hers. I explained to her that it was just a tradition in many upscale French restaurants. She called it sexist and said it was ridiculous. I told her that it's just the way it is in these kinds of places, and that we shouldn't have come here if she was upset by this.

She wanted me to ask for a menu with prices for her. I refused because we already had the prices and I didn't want to make a scene. She demanded that I confront a waiter about it or she would walk out. I called her bluff and she ended up staying, but didn't talk to me for the whole meal, which was delicious by the way.

We've been back home for several months but she keeps bringing it up. I'm honestly considering ending the relationship over this because she will not stop talking about. She keeps accusing me of being sexist (I'm not) and has been making ridiculous comparisons.

So I followed through with my warning, and went on the computer and deleted his favorite Minecraft world. I also took away computer privileges for the next month. When I told him, he started screaming and crying. He told me that he spent a whole year working on that world, and he's very distraught that he's never going to see it again. He has been crying and sobbing throughout the day, and has refused to eat any of his meals.",False,False,AmItheAsshole,AITA for deleting my son's Minecraft world?,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gap4oq/aita_for_deleting_my_sons_minecraft_world/,2020,-0.3727

I (52M) am the father of 3 kids, 15F, 7F, and 7M. The last two are twins and are very close, having the tendency to copy each other. I love and adore them all equally.

My son is not a very masculine kid, and is less interested in some of my hobbies because of this. He has always preferred whatever his mother and older sister did, like baking or dancing. I have no problem with this, I love him as he is, but to be honest, I’m slightly disappointed that we haven’t had the kind of amazing father-son bonding that I got to have with my Grandpa (my Dad died when I was pretty young) when I was a kid.  

Since I’m at home almost all the time now, I’ve been seeing just *how* feminine his interests have gotten. Asking to help cook every meal, helping his older sister alter second-hand clothes, and playing pretend. He’s even asked to have his sister paint his nails. I’m not upset or bothered by it, but it isn’t typical for young boys. 

I’ve been working out at home instead of at the gym because of our current circumstances, and when my son came in while I was lifting weights in the family room, he showed an interest in it. He was excited about the idea of having big muscles, and tried out some of the 5lb ones. Even though he mentioned being like She-Ra (from some new Netflix reboot, I think?), it was still progress in my eyes and it seemed like he was showing interest in masculine hobbies. I praised him and did the whole *”wow, you’re so strong!”* thing in kid-talk to encourage him. 
 
When his sisters walked in, the twin (7F) joined in. Like I said, they have the tendency to want to do what the other is doing so she expected the same kind of “wow, so strong!” stuff. When I wasn’t as enthusiastic with her and focused on my son, my oldest got annoyed and asked why I was treating them differently. I explained to her that because he hadn’t taken interest in these kinds of masculine hobbies before, I wanted to foster his own identity as a boy separate from his twin sister. She accused me of being misogynistic for this! She then said that I was TA for making his sister feel weaker and implying that I didn’t approve of his feminine interests. I don’t think I’m TA, because there’s no reason for my daughter to be inclined towards this kind of thing, but my son should be developing a more masculine personality as he gets older. 

When she told my wife (41F), she also blew up at me, saying I was acting like a cartoon misogynist. Both of them are pissed. So, Reddit, AITA?


|Edit:| Hey everyone. I was 100% TA. I appreciate that some people tried to empathize and say NTA or NAH to be charitable, but I’m in the wrong here and I knew it deep down while I was writing the post. Re-reading it, I feel ridiculous for writing that all out. I want to say thank you, because these comments where the objective kick in the ass I really needed! I realize now that I was really out of line for saying that shit and making my daughters feel that way. I set up a stupid false dichotomy, and my daughter was very right, I was being a misogynist. No excuse for that. I apologized to both of them and my wife an hour after I posted. I also shared this post with my little brother, who, as I mentioned in a comment, was teased for being effeminate as a kid/teen, especially after he came out. I think some people took me mentioning that as blaming him, which wasn’t my intention at all- none of my behavior is his or anybody else’s fault. 

We talked for a while and that (along with many of the comments you guys left!)  made me aware of how badly I’m treating my son. My Grandpa, who raised my brother and I for most of our lives, was a “manly” guy who I’ve always idolized completely. Well, my brother made me aware that my Grandpa in particular made him feel shitty about his femininity and his sexual orientation. He would regularly say degrading, terrible things. I was oblivious to just how much that hurt him, and it seems that I’ve picked up some of these same ideas. I’ve been such a dick for so long, and now that I realize how absurd some of the ideas I’ve held onto are, I know how much of a disservice I’ve done to my boy. I shouldn’t try to make him change just to protect him from bullies. In this situation, I’m the bully as much as it hurts to think. 

I’m planning on talking with him about this issue and apologizing. If we can this week, I want to let him choose something that he likes that we can do together. I’m not going to make the same mistakes my Grandpa did. At my brother’s and some redditors’ suggestions, I’m considering trying out therapy or a support group. After a mistake (huge fuck up) like this, I think I ought to try to be the best dad (and big brother!) I can be and work to stop thinking that way, especially when I’ve already done so much damage. 

I’m sorry about the extremely long edit, but thank you for your responses and helping me with this issue. I showed my wife some comments and she also thanks you all!

|Edit 2|: This will probably be the final update, but wow! I’m overwhelmed will all the responses, I wasn’t expecting so many. Thank you to everyone, I’m glad you guys were honest (but still encouraging!). I’m sorry I haven’t been able to reply to you all. I got a lot of really kind and personal messages and I want you guys to know I’ve taken it to heart.

Some people asked what I’m going to do with my daughters, since it seems like I focused more on my son in the edit. My oldest wants to try Krav Maga, so in the coming weeks we’re hoping to find a place that’ll accommodate both ages. Youngest daughter has wanted to learn how to roller skate too, so my 15 year old may have to teach us both!

I was able to talk to my son for a while this morning and apologize for yesterday. Talking about gender roles and all the trauma surrounding my Grandpa may be something I’ll talk to him more about as he gets older, but I got the message across that I support whatever he’s interested in. I asked him about She-Ra (some commenters told me that it’s fun for adults too) and we watched a few episodes together. You guys were right! My oldest and I both thought it was very cute. I asked him what he would want to do together, and he mentioned trying to alter something. I brought down a box of my old stuff from the attic and lo and behold- I found one of the 80s Hawaiian shirts my grandpa bought me (probably an effort to make me look like Tom Selleck). With some guidance from my oldest, we’re going to try to make it fit my son with room for him to grow into it. I think it’ll turn out nicely, and because it’s “really vintage” my 15 year old loves it. 

So everything is pretty good right now. I invited my brother over (lives a few hours away) for dinner so my son and I can make him something. I can’t believe that I was feeling upset about him liking baking and everything, I’m lucky that my boy wants to help everyone. So, I’m definitely TA, but I’m slowly becoming NTA! Thank you all. I showed my oldest some of my favorite comments and she thinks they’re great and I should expect a “clown of the year” award for a father’s day gift, haha!","AITA for praising my son differently than my daughter?Throwaway account + obligatory mobile formatting apology.

She’s 19, almost 20, and I have three sons aged 18, 16 and 15. She’s a really good kid and she’s a good influence on my sons, I really enjoy having her around. My wife and her daughter moved into my house and sold theirs. My stepdaughters father isn’t present in her life, nor is my sons’ mother. All four children share a bathroom.

My sons have never lived for a long period of time with a woman, nor have any of them had long term girlfriends. They had short visitation periods when they were younger but never longer than an hour, so living with two women has been unusual for them. 

My eldest son, 18, came to me last week and told me that his stepsister disposes of her used sanitary products in the trash can they share, but doesn’t use toilet roll or sandwich bags to disguise what they are, and it makes him uncomfortable which I think is reasonable. My sons are teenage boys and don’t want to see their stepsisters period products on full display.

A few nights ago I went into the kitchen to grab a snack and she was there doing some work for university. My wife had mentioned that she knew she was on her period so I took it as an opportunity to have a word with her. I told her my sons were uncomfortable and asked her if she’d mind putting her used products in diaper bags or flushing them down the toilet. 

She laughed and told me it was rich coming from a man who “sheds like a gorilla” and has produced “three skid marking sons” which I thought was just an unnecessary attack.

Thankyou for your input","AITA for telling my stepdaughter to stop using period products in the bathroom she shares with my teenage sons?I have been living with my new wife and stepdaughter for about 6 months now. She’s 19, almost 20, and I have three sons aged 18, 16 and 15. She’s a really good kid and she’s a good influence on my sons, I really enjoy having her around. My wife and her daughter moved into my house and sold theirs. My stepdaughters father isn’t present in her life, nor is my sons’ mother. All four children share a bathroom.

My sons have never lived for a long period of time with a woman, nor have any of them had long term girlfriends. They had short visitation periods when they were younger but never longer than an hour, so living with two women has been unusual for them. 

My eldest son, 18, came to me last week and told me that his stepsister disposes of her used sanitary products in the trash can they share, but doesn’t use toilet roll or sandwich bags to disguise what they are, and it makes him uncomfortable which I think is reasonable. My sons are teenage boys and don’t want to see their stepsisters period products on full display.

A few nights ago I went into the kitchen to grab a snack and she was there doing some work for university. My wife had mentioned that she knew she was on her period so I took it as an opportunity to have a word with her. I told her my sons were uncomfortable and asked her if she’d mind putting her used products in diaper bags or flushing them down the toilet. 

She laughed and told me it was rich coming from a man who “sheds like a gorilla” and has produced “three skid marking sons” which I thought was just an unnecessary attack. I’ve been nothing but nice to the girl and it’s hardly a comparison. My sons shouldn’t be subjected to her unhygienic products if it makes them uncomfortable.

My girlfriend and I have been together for over 2 years. She has always been very neat, tidy, and very polished. She cares about her appearance, and I appreciate that.

So this situation makes no sense to me.

We were at a very fancy event with a few of my friends (social distancing rules, every one wore masks etc.) My girlfriend was wearing a beautiful white dress, which I recently bought for her. The dress was very expensive.  We were all having a good time.

However, at one point, she excused herself to go the bathroom, and then I didn't see her again until she sent me a text from the car asking if we could go home.

Obviously I'm slightly annoyed because I didn't want to leave so soon. When I reached the car and asked why she wanted to go home, she told me that she got her period unexpectedly. I asked why she didn't bring extra tampons or pads (or use those tracking apps) she tried to defend herself by saying that she did everything she could, and that she had a period stain, and didn't want to stay because of the stain. 

She asked me to lie to my friends, and tell them that she was feeling  ""unwell"" so that she could go home. She had a man's jacket (a mutual friend of ours) covering her legs (and the nasty stain) and pleaded with me to take her home so she could shower and unwind.

I took her home and lied to my friends. When she was getting out of the car, the stain was very noticeable, it was very big and essentially ruined an expensive dress which I bought. She also made me purposefully lie because she wasn't prepared enough, and made me miss an event with my friends. Needless to say, I was extremely pissed. 

She said I was not being considerate and went to go lie down because she had a ""headache"" (she wanted to lie down after she took a shower)

She woke up and I haven't spoken to her properly until she apologizes, and gives back the friends jacket. I don't think I'm an AH, but when I told my friend (the same friend who gave her a jacket) he told me that I was the AH, and my GF kind of agreed.

AITA?

EDIT: I guess I'm the AH. I logged out of this account about an hour after posting because the response was terrible, and then came back to a TON of responses calling me the AH.

After my girlfriend came home from returning the jacket, she apologized for ruining the dress and I apologized for being a dumbas and not understanding the whole 'period' thing.

There really is no reason for us to choose truth since we already know a lot about each other so we mostly went just with dares. It was pretty fun and we had some weird challenges.

I was staying next to my friends brother and when it was my turn a classmate challenged me to kiss him. His sister immediately told my friend to change the dare and so she did. To be clear, her brother did not say anything when he heard the dare and just laughed so he definitely looked like he was ok with it right? Well WRONG because after I kissed him he told me wtf I am doing and looked like he was really grossed out by it. I was honestly a bit offended and asked him why he is so grossed by me kissing him, I am actually a pretty ok looking girl and even if I wasn’t, there was no reason for him to act like this. He ended up leaving the game and my friend told me that what I did was wrong on so many levels and to get out of her house. My other classmates didn’t say anything so I think they were on my side but didn’t want to participate in this argument (I will ask them when they go back home). Anyways I did end up leaving.

Could you please instead of commenting, DM me if your judgement is ‘YTA’? I promise if I get a lot of YTA dms I am going to ACCEPT the judgement as per rule 3 but it’s just weird if my friend sees this and sees ‘YTA’ comments especially after our last argument, you guys get what I mean right? Thank you.

I accept my judgement","AITA For kissing my friends brother without his consent during a truth or dare?Yesterday I was supposed to spend the night at my friends house with some of my classmates and we were playing truth or dare. There really is no reason for us to choose truth since we already know a lot about each other so we mostly went just with dares. It was pretty fun and we had some weird challenges.

I was staying next to my friends brother and when it was my turn a classmate challenged me to kiss him. His sister immediately told my friend to change the dare and so she did. To be clear, her brother did not say anything when he heard the dare and just laughed so he definitely looked like he was ok with it right? Well WRONG because after I kissed him he told me wtf I am doing and looked like he was really grossed out by it. I was honestly a bit offended and asked him why he is so grossed by me kissing him, I am actually a pretty ok looking girl and even if I wasn’t, there was no reason for him to act like this. He ended up leaving the game and my friend told me that what I did was wrong on so many levels and to get out of her house. My other classmates didn’t say anything so I think they were on my side but didn’t want to participate in this argument (I will ask them when they go back home). Anyways I did end up leaving. Do you guys think I was the asshole here?

We have a daughter (5). 

She’s been grouchy her whole pregnancy so her sister offered to plan her a gender reveal party. 

The plan was that all the food and decorations would be blue or pink and in the end we’d get one of those special sparklers that would light 
up in either blue or pink to reveal the gender. 

We went to the doctor and got her to write the result in a folded piece of paper that we passed over to her sister without looking.

So flash forward to the day of the party and the moment of truth comes and the sparkler turns out to be pink for a girl.

I don’t know what came over me but all I felt at that moment was very bitter disappointment. To be honest, all I was hoping for for baby #2 is to be able to toss a ball around with him and coach little league. Or watch him go on Boy Scouts camping trips. 

I know my daughter is only five, but I’ve already started to deal with the dramas of being a father of a girl and the thought of having to double up now on the neuroticism was harrowing.

I grew up in a house with three older boys and one younger sister and I can’t imagine seeing myself be outnumbered.

My wife grabbed my arm as people were approaching us to say their congratulations and said I needed to look happier. At that moment I just snapped. I shook my head and walked out to my car ( we came separately) and drove to my sister’s (21F) house.

I start getting texts from my sister in law and my wife saying “ way to reenact” their dad leaving their mom when they were 10 and 12. 

I felt like that accusation was unfair and that I just needed some time alone. I didn’t ask to be flabbergasted- it just happened. And I don’t think it’s fair that they would have demanded I smile and nod for the next couple of hours.

A little bit after 2 pm she messaged me that she wasn’t feeling well and thought that she may have to go home, if it was possible if I could get off from work earlier. I asked her to try and hold out until the end of the day. Not too long after she called me crying, saying that something was wrong and she had to go home. 
She was drunk clearly, she drank the hard seltzer’s. I told her to leave and she walked home. 
She messaged me the next day and said that she now knew that hard seltzer’s were alcohol, and she hadn’t know, she never drank before as both of her parents were alcoholics and she has diagnosed PTSD regarding alcohol, she never planned on drinking in general. I told her not to come back as she put my children in danger. She called me crying and saying that she didn’t know, and that she cared deeply about my children and would never ever drink with them, or at all, and that she needs the money to pay for her drivers permit (she comes from a not so well off family). I told her to find a real job and that it wasn’t my fault she got drunk. 
My husband says I’m being very rude and that she did try to reach out when she wasn’t feeling well. My kids are upset to see her go.

I’m on a business trip until Saturday but I drive back in time to be there Saturday morning before she woke up. 

A while after she wakes up, the doctor comes in. My wife says to stay with her so I say ok. He takes a deep breath and said that from the transvaginal ultrasound and CT scan results, she has ovarian cancer.

My wife starts sobbing but at first I stay still because I don’t even know what to make of it. 

My wife asks what that means for her and he says that she’ll likely at least need a full hysterectomy, and they’d have to remove the Fallopian tubes as well as the ovaries. 

That news jolted me from my chair. Because the doctor was effectively telling me that she wouldn’t be able to have kids after this, and after years of work, I thought we’d finally have a family.

I’m overwhelmed with emotions of anger, not just anger at the disease, but pent up anger form the fact that I had begged her to have kids since we were 26, but she refused for her career.

And now instead of becoming a real family, I didn’t even know if she would remain the woman I married, whether the last picture of us together would be last time I’d remember her looking beautiful, young, and carefree. Because the wife I as in front of me was already a different person. 

My wife started to grab my hand and say “ We’ll fight this and we’ll adopt.” 

But I shook my head and turned to walk out the door. I still had my suitcase in the car so I drove to a hotel because I didn’t know if my wife was going to end up being discharged or what.

I get a call from my MIL saying that if I was at a hotel or “ wherever else” I should just stay there. 

AITA for walking out? I admit it was done on impulse but this diagnosis just sliced my life and my wife’s life wide open.

My girlfriend and I got into a huge fight. I said she should be embarrassed to be seen in public like that. She said the only thing she was embarrassed by was me. She hasn’t spoken to me or done anything for me since. My friend said I was horrible and called me trash. I shouldn’t have lied, but I think my girlfriend should take what I think about her clothes into consideration and I’m not sorry for expecting her dress more appropriately in public. Am I really such an asshole here?

EDIT: I’m sure you all will be pleased to know we broke up tonight. She said I’m to controlling and narrow minded so she broke up with me.

Me, my husband and our 15 year old daughter Georgia went to my sister's place for lunch this weekend. 

Georgia is very bright. She completed her exams early and is now studying more advanced material. She's a big fashionista, a lot more than I was at that age. She loves pretty clothes and outfits, and we're happy to get her as much as we can, provided she behaves well and keeps up the good grades. 

The lunch with my sister was fairly casual, but Georgia wore her new pink dress.

My sister isn't as well off as we are unfortunately. She is raising three children on her own and her job isn't a high paying one. In the past, she asked me if Georgia could ""tone down"" her outfits when we come to visit, because she doesn't want her kids being upset because they can't afford things like that. 

I do get my sister's point but it's not down to me to police what Georgia wears. I have spoken to Georgia about it but I left the final decision to her. 

Anyway so we went for lunch, and Georgia ended up getting into an argument when my sister's 13 year old, Lucy, asked about the dress and where it was from. Georgia answered that it didn't matter because Lucy couldn't afford it anyway. We told Georgia to shut up as soon as the comment left her lips, but it soon ended up with Georgia and Lucy screaming at each other. 

My sister made the kids vanilla milkshakes, and Lucy decided to throw hers all over Georgia, ruining the dress. Georgia burst into tears and to be fair my sister did bring her a change of clothes. I said that if the dress was permanently ruined, I wanted my sister to reimburse us.  

My sister has refused and said that it was ""our responsibility"" because my daughter wore an expensive dress despite being warned not to.

That dress cost a couple of hundred, and washing it has failed to completely remove the stains. Frankly, I don't care about my sister's warnings. We can't make Georgia wear what she doesn't want to, and it's not our problem that she can't control her child and stop her ruining a beautiful dress.

Hi, all. I (F30) have been dealing with chronic medical issues all my life. I married my (33) husband, L, a few years ago and had my daughter A (5) soon after.

When I was pregnant with A, I was warned that it would be difficult due to my issues and that she would likely have some passed on from me. I accepted this, and I expected it. She was delivered and was a beautiful baby girl who didn't have my issues at the time.

However, as she got older, it became more apparent that she inherited my medical problems. One of which has an optional surgery that could negate it entirely. It's possible to live with it instead of choosing to operate, but the surgery will eliminate it.

I have some trauma with hospitals in general. I've had to be in and out of them my entire life, and it's left some deep wounds. It's awful to spend your formative years stuck in a sterile room with an IV and in pain. I've spent some time in therapy for it, but I still hate them.

The surgery that would remove the problem is covered by insurance, so money isn't a problem. However, it has a long recovery period, and I don't want my daughter to have to suffer through that.

I've told L that I don't want her to have to go through the lengthy process of recovery. He disagrees and has asked my family members to ""knock some sense"" into me. (His words, not mine.) It's become a big point of contention between us, and I refuse to budge.

So, AITA?

Edit: For those who want to know, she has radioulnar synostosis in both arms. She'd have to spend weeks in casts with both arms.

Edit 2: You are right. I was letting my own fear cloud my judgement. Thank you. Although, a bit rude to say that I should get sterilized, no?

Edit 3: While I understand that I was undoubtedly TA here, it's disgusting how many people have written horrible comments, sent messages, and just been total jerks. You do not know me. I don't know you. This is ONE moment in my and your life, and I sincerely don't understand why you have to be so nasty about it.

No, I will not sterilize myself. I will not kill myself, give up my child, or divorce my husband. I will not categorize myself as an abusive narcissistic sadist who hates my child and wants her to suffer like I have. I don't appreciate being psychoanalyzed by armchair psychiatrist Redditors.

I’ll cut right to the problem: my sisters and I are going for an overnight trip late this month. With my oldest sister’s work schedule the only time we can go for the foreseeable future is the 29th. This has been planned for several weeks.

Bindi announced to me this week that her school is doing a Halloween dance on the 29th. She was so excited and was excitedly planning her costume, I hated to burst her bubble but I had to tell her she can’t go. You see, Fritz is severely autistic (exactly what you’re probably thinking, he’s nonverbal, no eye contact, no toilet training, that sort of thing). This makes him much more difficult to leave with someone than his sisters ever were – I could easily find a sitter for them when they were younger. The only people who will even take Fritz outside our household are his grandparents, who cannot watch him that weekend. He also does well with Bindi, meaning she is literally our only option.

Bindi didn’t take it well and asked me why Ava can’t watch him for a few hours while she’s at the dance, since Ava has babysat before. Well, Ava is having surgery the Monday before that, nothing major but she is not going to be healed up enough to deal with one of her brother’s meltdowns by Friday. (I’m not saying that would happen but it’s always a possibility with him). She can help but someone else needs to be there and that someone else is going to have to be Bindi.

She responded by saying she “didn’t realize her siblings were so much more important” and went up to her room scowling. I’ve tried knocking and calling her, but she keeps sending me straight to voicemail. I get that she’s upset and was really looking forward to this dance (it’s only for juniors and seniors and school didn’t have it last year thanks to COVID), but I’m going to need her to make a small sacrifice for the family right now.

Miranda is very successful in life, she has a nice apartment, works a good job and earns a decent amount of money. Alice, on the other hand, is struggling financially.

Miranda looked at me and laughed. She said it wasn’t her business to feed six people, that Alice was old enough to make her choices and live with the consequences. She knew what she was getting herself into and that she wouldn’t pay Alice’s way through life just because she kept having children she couldn’t afford.

I was stunned at how cold she reacted. I asked her how she could live her life being so selfish and uncaring, and she got angry and told me, “Listen, kid, there are some thing you are way too young for to be discussing with me, and this is one of those.

I told her, “No wonder your husband divorced you, even if you could have children, you would be a terrible mother.” Miranda got very quiet and told me to leave and never come back.

She said that she already felt better and didn't wanted to tell me because I was going to be worried about nothing. I said that it wasn't nothing if she had fainted and that I should be aware of these things to help her. She said that now it would be just a funny story about how Jeff broke the door and roommate had to cover her with a towel so they could come to the rescue of her naked body.

That moment I saw red. I asked if Jeff had seen her naked and she said she couldn't be sure since she was unconscious but roommate said that he stood out of the bathroom until she was covered. I asked if Lydia thought it was fair to me not to know that another guy had seen her naked and she said he didn't actually saw her naked and that it shouldn't matter since he was only helping.

1. My issue is that she said the party was a gender reveal, if she had called it just a party I would have come. But calling it a gender reveal makes it sound like it's for the lizard, and I'm not going to that even if it is a ""joke"". 
2. I don't know why it matters but the Skink is a girl which is why I said ""I'm not coming to a gender reveal unless it's for a real grand daughter."" 
3. Even though I don't agree with my daughter for being childfree, I have been supportive and only shown mild frustration. The reasons she decided to be childfree is she claims she's asexual, she just doesn't want one, she has emotional baggage and feels unable to care for a real child, she fears pregnancy, and she has a carrier gene like me and ""doesn't want to go through what I did"" (I had 4 miscarriages and a highly defect child that died after 3 months due to the gene). Yes there has been slight tension between us because I think she just hasn't found the right man (she never dated growing up) and her other fears are unnecessarily exaggerated, but it's ultimately her decision and I don't resent her.
4. We haven't seen each other in three months.

We sat for dinner and talked about the house a bit. Me, my husband and Jess continued conversing after Ethan excused himself to take an important call. Jess showed me the original key to the house and I asked if she made copies yet and she said no. I said she should and also give one copy to me as well. She looked at me funny and asked why she should. I explained that it is necessary so that it could be used in emergencies. she rudely said ""I don't know what kind of an emergency that would require you having a key to our house, sure won't be a fire incident!"". She obviously didn't seem to have any idea that a fire incident wasn't what I meant and I got offended by her sarcasm. I pointed out that it's not just her decision because this is my son's house as well. She smiled at me trying to be polite and stated that only the ones who contributed towards the house get a copy and that I really don't need one anyway. Also assured me that my son will have the same answer for me. Basically saying ""Don't bother bring this up with Ethan, he'll tell you the same thing"" but I did and she spoke on his behalf the entire argument repeating what she said over and over. Things escalated to her calling me pushy and me telling her she was being unnecessarily rude and disrespectful .

My husband and I left in a rush and I felt horrible. My husband went on and on about how paranoid and controlling I was to basically be ""demanding"" a copy of the key to the new house but again I stated that I was just trying to be helpful and taking extra precautions since anything could happen but he insisted I overstepped and ruined Ethan's and Jess's joy for their new house as well as dinner.

I genuienly do not think what I said was out of line and I'm not sure why Jess reacted so intensely. I think my request was innocent.","AITA for asking my son and daughter inlaw for a copy of the key to the new house they bought?

We had a good evening and everyone seemed to like him, but when we drove back home he brought it up again and said he thinks it was kinda fucked up of me to expect him to eat meat, when I know how much it disgusts him.

My wife (23) and I (27) are expexting. She's due this month and things have been bit intense recently with her being extra hormonal.


We live in different state then my family. My wife and I couldn't visit for Christmas. my parents were calling to continue complaining about us not spending Christmas with them and demanded I make it up for them. I said I was open for any suggestions they had and they suggested they come stay with us for a week once the baby is born. That way they could spend time with us and the baby as well. I thought why not that seemed to be a pretty good suggestion since it's been months since we've seen each others so I told them to go ahead and made the invitation Official. This morning my wife was talking about her plans once the baby is here and that's when I remembered my conversation with my parents. I immediately told her that I agreed to let them over for a week once the baby is born to make up for the holiday we missed with them. She first looked shocked then freaked out at me saying I shouldn't have invited them just like that without talking to her first. I asked why not since she loves them and loves being around them but she explained that my family can be a lot of work and having them as guests while caretaking for a newborn is the last thing she wanted. I told her it was no big deal besides that we could use help if she thought about this way but she lashed out on me about how the first few days of the baby's life is essential time for bonding and being intimate and I just took that away from her by inviting my parents and invading her space. I argued that she was being melodramatic right then because my family are decent people and I'm pretty sure they'll make this experience a lot more warmer but she still disagreed and said if my family were decent then they wouldn't have accepted my invitation but I clarified to her that I did NOT invitem and this was in fact a suggested made by them and I just agreed AFTER they complained about me missing spending the holidays with them. She went off on me demanding I call them and cancel everything I planned with them but I thought that was unacceptable since she gave not a good-enough reason for me to do that and besides my parents can help but she still denied that being true.

She's gone radio silence for the rest of the day and is acting like my family are somehow making her uncomfortable though they're not the judgemental or intrusive type and are just about spending time with each others. AITA?


Hold on! #Edit few things so there's no misunderstanding here. Alright?

First of all my wife doesn't normally have an issue with my family being around, they all get along pretty good. and second of all which is an important info my wife and I talked about having her directly speak to them about why she would rather postpone their visit so we could clear the air but she refused and said she doesn't want to ruin her relationship with them and asked me to do it (tell them not to come) but since my family are upset with me then me telling them not to come might be taken in an offensive way, you know what I'm saying? so it really feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

also, to all the people saying that my wife shouldn't be hosting guests. I don't recall mentioning this nor expecting her to do anything for the family. matter of fact I really thought we could maybe use their help especially my mom.","AITA for agreeing to have my family visit for a week after my wife gives birth?throwaway for privacy.

Hi. A couple of weeks ago we had a new employee hired at the company. he's a good guy and a widower named ""James"" (36) and to my knowledge his late wife passed away 8 months ago. Me (f32) and the other coworkers got along well with him. However I noticed that he is still wearing his wedding band on his finger. It kind of confused me a bit and I couldn't help but bring it up with him while on lunch break.


We talked and I pointed out that he was being misleading by still wearing his wedding band when he's a widower. He looked quite bothered by what I said but I tried to explain that I think that he was giving people the wrong idea or impression about his relationship status since he's technically single and on his own right now (don't want to sound cruel but I'm speaking from technical angle).
James said that he didn't give it much thought (meaning he don't care what people think) and that even if he wasn't wearing his wedding band and some woman approached him he'd still turn them down since he's obviously not interested.

For some reason things got awkward and everyone stopped eating and just stared at James and me.
I told him I don't know but that really really felt generally misleading of him as in making people think he is in a relationship (married) when he is not regardless of how he felt about being in a relationship. He got upset, called me rude, and said that I repeatedly disrespected his marriage and his late wife's memory with what I said then took his stuff and walked away. My co workers said regardless of who is right or wrong (though some said he overreacted) there was no reason for me to bring this up on the first place and cause a scene and make James upset with us like that now he's not speaking to me and others who sided with me.


AITA? Did I overstep or did he overreact?

This was just a conversation we were casually having with the other co workers and I didn't use any insensitive tones or anything but we had a discussion and it suddenly turned into an argument. I tried to let things calm down but the situation got out of my hand unexpectedly.","AITA for telling my new co worker it was misleading of him to be wearing his wedding band when he's a widower?

My M30 brother in law M20 ""Sean"" moved in with me and his sister after my father in law passed away few months ago.

He is the private type and keeps to himself. He goes out and never say where he's going or how long he'll be out, eats at random times during the day, wears earpuds while me and the kids are sitting with him. See, all of these are uncool behaviors and a bad influence on my children. I've already talked to Sean about certain house rules I have and how he was violating them maybe because he didn't but now he knows and still nothing's changed.


Last night, he came home late at around 10pm. I wasn't thrilled with that because he knew the rules but he said that he was an adult and I shouldn't be policing him but it's not about that, it's about the fact that he's repeatedly disrespected the homeowner and the rules...So I told him this: ""If he won't respect the rules which are: Being home at 8, not eating at random times, and not using his electronics just like my kids aren't allowed when the family is gathered to spend time together. He ranted about how he wasn't a child, my child and called me unreasonable to treat him this way just because he lives under my roof, I told him it's not hard to show respect really but my wife went off asking what was wrong with me to be giving Sean who's still grieving, ultimatums and treating him like a child. I explained to her that I'm just making sure the kids won't be influenced by her brother's reckless behavior and she laughed asking if I think Sean being on his phone was reckless but that is besides the point. She called me a control freak and told me to get off her brother's back and leave him alone. I replied that she's just saying this because he's her brother but she said I overstepped and should back off and stop trying to control her adult brother. I asked her if she was happy with him coming home late and she said she was sick of arguing then went upstairs.

Until then, we had 50/50 custody, but Sandra has always been less ""strict"" than me. She's always let Aria do what she wants and has never had any home rules. She also buys Aria everything she wants so she will want to live with her. 

Sandra lives in the same town where Aria's highschool was, while I live 25 mins away. So, one of my rules was that if she went to meet up with a friend there (meaning I had to drive her), the next time they met it was her friend's turn to come. If the friend's parents didn't want to drive the kid here, then Aria wasn't allowed to meet them again while she was with me. Everything was fine that way for years. 

The major fallout happened in her last year of highschool (she was 15). She went on a trip to another country with her school and didn't bother to send more than a couple texts when she was away for 5 days. So I decided to ground her, because she had to learn to respect and show some love for her family. She insisted she had sent messages to her mother but we had barely heard from her.  She's never had a lot of friends, but she had been invited her to some popular girl's birthday party. This was my punishment, not going to that party after forgetting about her family.

She got upset and started calling her mother to come pick her up, but it was illegal to get her if it was my week. Plus, she wanted to go to her mother's because she would lift my punishment and let her go to the party. Her mother came by the end of the week and I told Aria that she didn't have to come back if she didn't want to. I waited, but I heard nothing from her again. Her sister kept asking me why she didn't come back, and I didn't know how to explain to her that she didn't love us and that she preferred staying with her mother, her parties and her free-of-rules life.

Over the years we've communicated through lawyers, because Sandra has 0 intentions on helping me get my daughter back (she finally has her to herself). They've been demanding that I pay for child support, even now that she's 21 years old. I have to pay for that and for half of her college expenses (by law). When Aria turned 18, an adult, I started adding up everything I had to pay in an Excel that I send to Sandra when I update it so she knows what damage she is doing to our daughter (I expect Aria to pay her debt, but I gave Sandra the option to pay for her to which she refused). We are now at 18K.

Aria has been trying to get in touch again. I told her that we can't fix the emotional part unless we fix the money part first. She needs to prove to me that she doesn't only care about the money.

My wife (27) and I (27) have a 4 year old son, we've been having an incredibly busy work schedule of the last 2 years and family's been doing a great job helping out with our son.

we usually have members of my inlaws take our son whenever we have a work trip or a shift coming up. from my wife's mom to her sister to her dad except for my 31 year old brother in law (wife's brother). He's made it clear he is just not interested in spending time with his nephew, keeps saying that the reason for that is that he's actually ""child free"". for so many emergencies he has turned me and my wife away when we begged him to watch our son  and he didn't even budge or apologize for his attitude.


it all came to head a couple of days ago, I had a work meeting while my wife was out of town and my inlaws were attending a wedding so no one was free to watch my son except for my BIL. I showed up to his place and told him I was desperate for help and needed him to just watch my son for 2 hours. he refused, even suggested I take him with me to work but that's not a good suggestion. I begged him and he just said no. I had enough I confronted him and asked why? does he not like his nephew and he threw that ""no it's just that I'm child free"" excuse which made me lose it. I told him to just stop because it's cringe of him to keep saying that and use it as an excuse to be unsupportive of me and his sister and cold towards his nephew. I told him he should really do better and stop being so negative but he got mad and said I had no right to disrespect his lifestyle/choices but it's the attitude that gets me. we had a exchange of words where he said my son isn't his responsibility whatsoever then I left.


he complained to my inlaws and they ""called me out"" for disrespecting their son and treating him like that. They insisted that he's not responsible for my son and I shouldn't expect so much from him then guilt him about it. they wanted me to apologize and my wife said I should but he was about as helpful and supportive as a rock so, I decided I will take my time before I consider apologizing.

Liz is the one with a much larger income, she got an even better job opportunity that is requiring us to move to another city. I agreed since I could easily find a job in my field in the city we're moving to. but after my family heard we were selling the house to move, hell broke loose.

Sunday, mom and Liz got into a huge fight because Liz told mom we'll move away and hire a babysitter for the kids so she's no longer ""needed"". mom said she doesn't want her grandkids moving away, even said we should let the kids live at her house while we move. Liz laughed at her and mom lost it basically saying that Liz was an ungrateful witch and that her grandkids moving will only happen over her dead body. they began exchanging harsher words and Liz snapped and told mom to butt out of private matters that don't concern her. and said that she had no right to decide things regarding the kids. Mom firmly told her she was dead wrong and proceeded to tell her that she, as an involved grandmother, knows her rights and she will be taking Liz and me to court to ensure she still gets to see her grankids. Liz was in shock, she looked to the left and saw me sitting there not saying or doing anything. She told me to check my mom but I told her she was being unfair to mom and that mom had to feel upset because she will no longer be able to see her grandchildren - I honestly told Liz that she was a bit selfish to not consider my mom's feelings and her crucial presence in the kids life first. Liz started arguing with me saying she couldn't believe I didn't stand behind her and defend her after hearing mom saying she'd get the court involved. I said mom was upset and can not be blamed for her reaction. Liz started yelling at me calling me unsupportive and an enabler then went home with the kids, insisting my family is MY problem and I should handle it although this whole moving thing was her idea.

Situation hasn't been resolved and Liz and mom are getting more intense in their fights. I choose to stay out of it because both have valid arguments but Liz has called me awful for not siding with her after seeing how mom spoke to her and being okay with the fact that mom was willing to cause us issues in court.

She went upstairs to get her camera that's when I grabbed the spoon and started filling my plate from every dish she's made and ""ruining"" the look as a result.

She came downstairs, saw the ""damage"" and blew up almost crying saying I just ruined her cooking project that she worked hours for as well as putting efforts into.

My wife and I are expecting our first baby together, We made an appointment to find out the gender of the baby. To me, this is very important (I had hopes for a boy) unfortunately, the day of the dr appointment I had to attend my friend's birthday that I remembered last minute. I asked my wife if we could cancel the appointment and go another day but she looked shocked that I even considered canceling the appointment and going to my friend's birthday, I said I had no choice. She said canceling the dr appointment was off the table because these appointments are restricted to specific time and date and we can't miss it so she'll go alone. I told her no because that'd be selfish of her and besides this will ruin the news of finding out if the baby is a boy or a girl. She cut the discussion and told me to go to the birthday party. I did then later found out she didn't cancel the dr appointment and went with her mom. I came home seething and blew up at her. I started arguing with her about going behind my back and doing this without me. She said it wasn't her fault I prioritized a party over my child. I told her I didn't prioritize anything; she literally could've canceled and we would've went another day but clearly, she was trying to steer the fight to a direction where I look like the neglectful and irresponsible one. We fought some then she said I'm probably angry with her because it's a girl but I responded that she was wrong. She went outside the room claiming I was ""stressing her out"". now acts like I owe her an apology on top of everything else but I feel upset and like I was decieved by her.


AITA?


INFO: first off ??? Jesus, I swear I came here thinking I was somewhat justified in my frustration but I was wrong it seems. Although I just wanna point out that I did not just go to the party without telling my wife and having a discussion with her first. Also the friend lives 2 hours away so I had to leave at 2 and the appoitment was at 4. I did not know she went and I would've appreciated it if she at least was upfront with me about what she did. She could've said she was going anyway but instead told me to go to the party and had me thinking she was going to cancel and reschedule.

I'll preface this by saying that I (M35) am a widower with 2 kids (9, 11). I recently got back to work and since I work nightshifts, I had to get the kids a babysitter (they're at school during the day and my sister stays with them) I was able to find a babysitter with the help of a co worker (actually they're related) and things have been going pretty well except for few days ago.


The babysitter called me while I was at work to tell me that my 9 year old daughter broke her glasses, I got home, heard both sides of the story and came to a conclusion that it was in fact an accident. but the babysitter said my daughter broke them intentionally after she refused to let her outside late in the evening. I asked my 11 year old daughter and she said the babysitter's story is accurate but since she and her sister have a beef then, I figured she lied to set her sister up. my 9 year old daughter cried and said she didn't mean it and it was an accident. I apologized to the babysitter for the misunderstanding but she insisted there was no misunderstanding and then asked me to pay her for a pair of new glasses. I was taken aback by her request and told her I thought we talked this out and rolled it out as an accident but she insisted it wasn't an accident. I apologized but refused and said it was unfair to expect me to pay, especially since she didn't pay attention to keep her glasses safe regardless of wether it was an accident or not. The babysitter argued with me then started crying swearing that my daughter broke them to get back at her. My 11 year old daughter sided with her but my 9 year old said she is only siding with the babysitter for her own benefits. The girls started fighting and I ended up telling the babysitter to leave. she got my co worker involved and she said I should take responsibility and pay the babysitter for new glasses since she can not afford them being a broke college student and in need for glasses. I apologized but refused to pay, my co worker got upset and shamed me for condoning my younger daughter's actions and treating the babysitter poorly when she's the victim in this situation.


It's been days and the babysitter is still wanting me to pay for new glasses but I feel like she's trying to use the fact that I'm in dire need of help and is hoping to get extra money out of my pocket.","AITA for refusing to pay the babysitter for new glasses after my daughter broke her old ones?

My son is 18, He is going to be attending community college and is living with me, my husband and his 2 younger half sisters.


The other day I found out that he found and accepted a job without telling me. I was upset with him about it and the reason for that is that first of all, he should've told me since we live in the same house and also, and more importantly now I'm left without someone to stay with the girls from 3 to 8 where my shift start-ends. my son is usually the one to stay home with the girls and his new job is during these hours so one way or another we are impacted.


He told me his friend found him this job and it just happened - but I don't think it did because he knew he had to give up staying with his sisters while I work. my husband travels most of the time (he's a pilot) and paid child care is a no for me. My son said I shouldn't be surprised by him trying to work to save money to be able to pay for himself but that is just absurd since he literally lives with us without having to pay for anything except for his own entertainment. He said he needed the job and he wasn't reallistically going to stay and watch his sisters for days on end especially he doesn't get paid for it. We kept arguing and my husband got involved and he too was upset saying that my son had no respect for us. my son basically had a ""like it or not"" attitude with us and kept refusing to discuss this wirh us saying we have no right to be upset with him and should just accept it. but I'm just...I think that he's being inconsiderate of my husband's and I's struggle to provide for the family as a whole. this should mean something to him but he acted selfishly.


ETA okay, it seems that I did not mention the reason why the babysitter option isn't ideal and is because my daughters don't want a babysitter. they're both dealing with some issues and are unconfortable being with a stranger at home. besides that my son decided to stay with them and we didn't ask him or anything.

ETA Okay, some of you here are implying or suggesting that I'm making my son to be the girls' babysitter but that is in fact not true. He doesn't do much for them, just stays home with them while he studies or plays video games. He adores his sisters and only stays with them when he wants to. otherwise we wouldn't force him.

I've made arrangements and even emptied a room for them to stay but for some reason, she was against it and said she'd rather spend the first few weeks at home with her newborn. not only that but she said no to the welcoming party.

But just a couple a days ago, We found out that my daughter in law had given birth 2 weeks ago and no one knew about it. My nephew told me and I immediately called my son, he confirmed it. he and his wife lied then hid the date of birth from the family. I told him this was not acceptable, lying just because they didn't want a welcoming party and love and support being given from family. I told him I was disappointed because for one...he ruined our welcoming for our grandbaby and also, I invited family members and they're all rightfully disappointed as well. He said it was his last resort after I kept pushing and made his wife uncomfortable but that was not appreciated because.. we were just trying to celebrate the new family member in a proper manner. We had an argument and he ended the call upon saying I ruined his joy for his newborn. My husband started texting him since he stopped replying to our phonecalls and now is threatening to block my nephew for tattling but I think that my nephew was decent enough to inform the family. otherwise God knows how long my son and his wife were going to hide their son just to keep us at arms length. We've always been kind and welcoming to my daughter in law and ger family, I don't why she would do this and disrespect the family like that.

on the other hand, some family members see it as a justified action because we insisted on the party.

My son ate cake, got a sugar rush, and crashed, making him cranky for the rest of the day after we left the party. 

I told my friend she needs to have some kind of consequences for her son to teach him not to peer pressure other children into eating things they're not allowed to have. She said because it wasn't an issue of allergies or health, that she's sorry my son was cranky but she won't be punishing her son or talking to him about it on his birthday.

I have full custody and her mom is not involved in her life. 

5 years ago I married my wife Nina(F31) we tried to have a child but couldn't. We went to the doctor and turned out I can't have anymore kids due to some complications. We decided to use an sperm donor and the result was a son, Mark, who was born a few months ago. 

The problems started when Nina got pregnant. Harper wasn't happy about it. When Mark was born things got worse. Before this Harper and I used to spend 2 days a week together, just the 2 of us without my wife but after Mark was born I couldn't do that anymore. I can't just leave my wife alone for 2 days a week with a newborn and Harper has been very angry about it. 

The main problem started 3 days ago. Nina and I decided to make a nursery for Mark instead of having him in our bedroom for multiple reasons. 

Our home has 4 bedrooms, 2 master bedrooms at one side and 2 bedrooms at the other side. One of the master rooms is ours, the other one is Harpers. It was very hard for Nina and I to go to the other side of the home multiple times at night when Mark wakes up so I asked Harper pack her stuff and go to one of the bedrooms so that we could give her room to Mark. At first everything seemed alright. She said ok and went to her room and started packing but less than an hour later my brother showed up at our home, asking for Harper. She had called him and asked him to take her. She came out of her room with her stuff, told me ""you can give it to your son now"" and left with my brother. I told her she could only go for one night but it has been 3 days and she is not back and wont even talk to me. 

Im receiving calls from my family all calling me an AH and other names. 

I dont trust their judgement, they very clearly favor Harper. She was the first grandchild in our family and everyone's favorite also they are trying to accept Mark as my son but I could see that they haven't been able yet so I decided to post here and get some unbiased opinions. AITA?

Edit: Here is the update that I promised 

I realized I've messed up so I went to my brothers home and tried to get Harper back but he didn't even let me see her, saying she doesn't want to see me. 

He said he would only let her go back if: 

1. She wanted to go with me 

2. We move to another home close to their home because they wanted to have Harper close to them to keep an eye on her and make sure we are treating her right, we used to live very close to them but when I got married my wife and family didn't get along so we moved somewhere farther away which made Harper very sad. 

3. Harper will get to choose which bedroom she wants in our new home 

4. I should spend 1 on 1 time with Harper at least one day a week 

Which I accepted. 

This caused a lot of problems since my wife doesn't like some of those conditions. she thinks they are not reasonable. She got angry, took Mark and went to her parents home and is staying there so now I'm also receiving texts from my inlaws calling me an AH. 

Right now Im looking for a new home that is closer to my brother's home 

I called Harper and my brother convinced her to talk to me for once. she was crying the whole time while telling me that she felt like I didn't want her anymore. Hearing her cry like that really broke my heart. I honestly never meant to hurt her. 

After so many apologies and gifts she finally agreed to see me. I will go to my brother's home everyday to spend time with Her. She has also finally agreed to come home with me when I find a new home.","AITA for taking away my daughters bedroom and giving it to my son?I(M32) have a daughter Harper(F14) from a previous relationship.

The problems started when Nina got pregnant. Harper wasn't happy about it. When Mark was born things got worse. Before this Harper and I used to spend 2 days a week together, just the 2 of us without my wife but after Mark was born I couldn't do that anymore. I can't just leave my wife alone for 2 days a week with a newborn and Harper has been very angry about it. 

The main problem started 3 days ago. Nina and I decided to make a nursery for Mark instead of having him in our bedroom for multiple reasons. 

Our home has 4 bedrooms, 2 master bedrooms at one side and 2 bedrooms at the other side. One of the master rooms is ours, the other one is Harpers. It was very hard for Nina and I to go to the other side of the home multiple times at night when Mark wakes up so I asked Harper pack her stuff and go to one of the bedrooms so that we could give her room to Mark. At first everything seemed alright. She said ok and went to her room and started packing but less than an hour later my brother showed up at our home, asking for Harper. She had called him and asked him to take her. She came out of her room with her stuff, told me ""you can give it to your son now"" and left with my brother. I told her she could only go for one night but it has been 3 days and she is not back and wont even talk to me. 

Im receiving calls from my family all calling me an AH and other names. 

I dont trust their judgement, they very clearly favor Harper. She was the first grandchild in our family and everyone's favorite also they are trying to accept Mark as my son but I could see that they haven't been able yet so I decided to post here and get some unbiased opinions. AITA?

Edit: Here is the update that I promised 

I realized I've messed up so I went to my brothers home and tried to get Harper back but he didn't even let me see her, saying she doesn't want to see me. 

He said he would only let her go back if: 

1. She wanted to go with me 

2. We move to another home close to their home because they wanted to have Harper close to them to keep an eye on her and make sure we are treating her right, we used to live very close to them but when I got married my wife and family didn't get along so we moved somewhere farther away which made Harper very sad. 

3. Harper will get to choose which bedroom she wants in our new home 

4. I should spend 1 on 1 time with Harper at least one day a week 

Which I accepted. 

This caused a lot of problems since my wife doesn't like some of those conditions. she thinks they are not reasonable. She got angry, took Mark and went to her parents home and is staying there so now I'm also receiving texts from my inlaws calling me an AH. 

Right now Im looking for a new home that is closer to my brother's home 

I called Harper and my brother convinced her to talk to me for once. she was crying the whole time while telling me that she felt like I didn't want her anymore. Hearing her cry like that really broke my heart. I honestly never meant to hurt her. 

After so many apologies and gifts she finally agreed to see me. I will go to my brother's home everyday to spend time with Her. She has also finally agreed to come home with me when I find a new home.",False,False,AmItheAsshole,AITA for taking away my daughters bedroom and giving it to my son?,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ul107a/aita_for_taking_away_my_daughters_bedroom_and/,2022,-0.5997

So my wife has a friend from childhood named ""Anthony"". I'm being completely honest here when I say that he and I don't get along. It's not like he is rude or disrespectful (nothing like that) but all I feel towards him is ""annoyance"" sort of speak because of how much my wife sees him. He lives alone and now suffers from a medical condition (Cancer) that requires him to go to the hospital regularly to receive treatment. I found out that my wife promised him to go with him to his every chemo treatment as support. She said it's a commitment she made to be there for him during this rough time since he has no one else besides him.

Okay.....I had no issue with that at first but then this started affecting me. e.g, I can't go see my friends because I have to stay with my son on X day so my wife could be with Anthony for his treatment etc etc. I've talked to her about it but she said that Anthony needs company and that she's just being supportive and this is when he needs her the most.


I let it go but last week was just kind of my last straw. Anthony had a other chemo session treatment and my wife wanted to go with him and asked me to stay home with our son. I told her I had a meet up with my mom and sister to eat lunch and that I won't be home, She said she needed to go be with him and I kind of flipped out at her and said that she doesn't ""need"" to be with him and could literally go see him at home the next day or something. She threw a fit and called me cruel for forcing her to leave Anthony by himself since she's all he has and that I was making her look bad. She also said my appointment with mom and sister wasn't as important as a chemo session but I decided to just leave to end the argument.

She ended up staying at home but kept ignoring me when I got back calling me selfish for not letting her be there to support Anthony with what he's going through. Some of her girlfriends think I'm being a controlling jerk with no consideration for Anthony and what's he's going through.

It was mom's and now belongs to Claire.""

My wife thinks my son is overreacting and it's only because due to his age and moving out he's never bonded with Sarah like Claire and I have, so he doesn't consider Sarah to be his real sister, otherwise he'd be happy for her. My wife thinks Claire will be happy about this since she considers Sarah to be her big sister and it will bring the girls even closer together because Sarah will happily share it with Claire and they'll both have it.

I told her that while I consider Sarah to be my daughter but she's not Kate's daughter, this belongs to Kate and should go to Kate's daughter. My wife said Claire is HER daughter, not anyone else's and wife accused me of playing favorites and told me that if I truly consider Sarah to be my daughter then I'll do the right thing for her or that I haven't really accepted Sarah as a real daughter yet.

I consulted my son (from Kate, 25 years old) and he told me that if I do this he's going to walk from the birthday party and that he bets he won't be the only one. He said if I do this I should be ready for severe consequences. He left in a very frustrated way. His argument in the end was that ""this isn't yours to give away. It was mom's and now belongs to Claire.""

My wife thinks my son is overreacting and it's only because due to his age and moving out he's never bonded with Sarah like Claire and I have, so he doesn't consider Sarah to be his real sister, otherwise he'd be happy for her. My wife thinks Claire will be happy about this since she considers Sarah to be her big sister and it will bring the girls even closer together because Sarah will happily share it with Claire and they'll both have it.

Problem is...Kevin thinks that my girls are not discipline simply because they don't follow everything he tells them because they don't see him as their father...We've already talked about that. Especially the part where he expects them to dress how he wants them to, and behave how he wants them too. He even called them ""weirdos"" but that's just how teenagers are and it's not a new thing.


Anyways. I told him he needed to loosen up a little and lessen his expectations of them but I get it's hard to do given he was brought up in a ""conservative"" household with hard-core Christian family.


Last week. He started a fight after seeing one of the girls' hairstyle and said that she was looking ""trashy"". Because of the we had to cancel our trip to the mall because he refused to drive us.


A couple of days ago. We wanted to go out for dinner. I was intending on getting off work at 6 but had some stuff to get done. My husband and I agreed that he'd take the girls and go to the restaurant and wait for me there. He called me before they got out of the house to complain about what the girls were wearing. The girls sent me pics and I thought nothing was wrong with their outfits and told him to drop it and just go. He said fine then muttered something about me enabling thrm then hung up.


While I was still at work I got a call from one of the girls telling me their stepdad had them stand and wait outside the restaurant because ""he didnt want to be seen with them dressing like that"". I was stunned I rushed to the restaurant and found them near the car. They explained he told them to wait in the car til he tell them to come in (basically wait for me) they started crying I had them get in my car then went inside the restaurant and found him on his phone. I went off on him and told him he should be ashamed of himself for treating my daughter's like if there was something to be ashamed of. He tried backpaddling saying it wasn't like that but I interrupted him then walked out after cancelling dinner.

We went home and he came back hours later trying to argue that I can't blame him for disapproving of what the girls ""recklessness"" and that he tried communicating but I shut him down and treated him as less of a parent when he's just wanting what's best for them.

He doesn't speak to me or the girls anymore.","AITA for telling my husband he should be ashamed of himself and taking the girls and going home after he made them wait outside of the restaurant?

When they’re are birthdays he needs a gift or opens the gifts and needs to blow out candles. It’s frustrating which is why I’m not usually around at family gatherings and other stuff. 

I was my SIL since her friend cancelled on her and I was helping make invitations. I saw one of the names were SIL’s nephew. I asked if she wanted him to go and she said yeah. She then asked why. So I told her why.

She turned around to leave and I looked at her and said “I told you so” she started crying even more now.

I came out 3 years ago and married my wife Jenna (42f) last year. She has a daughter, Nora (13f). We all live together as I have full custody of my daughter. It was kind of hard for her to adjust to having a second mom, but they got along well.

The girls have their birthdays very close, only two days apart, so we decided to have a joint birthday party for both of them, since Nora had a hard time making new friends (they moved in with us and she's very shy). Most of my family lives out of the country, so the gifts were sent a week early. It was a huge bag, with at least 20 gifts. The party was nice and we opened the bag at night once everyone left.

Jenna handed out the presents as she took them out. After 12 gifts in a row just for Amy, I checked the bag and froze to see that there was only one gift for Nora, from my parents. She pretended it wasn't a big deal, but as she opened the present I saw her eyes drop. It was a $15 tumbler from Walmart. Not to sound ungrateful, but Amy's gifts were much more expensive (lots of gift cards over $100, a new phone, limited-edition Funkos, designer clothes and lots of cards wishing her a happy birthday).

Needless to say, I blew up the family chat, calling out my parents, siblings, and extended family who sent gifts for not considering Nora and my parents for the cheap gift. No one took me seriously since: *""It's not our duty to give gifts to someone else's kid""* and *""Amy deserved them, since I didn't even throw her her own birthday party"",* emphasizing that Jenna and Nora are my problem, not theirs.

Nora was clearly hurt, since it's not the first time my family has left her out. At night, I asked Amy to share some of the gifts with her stepsister. Not all of them, just a couple of gift cards and some of the new clothes. Amy refused. This surprised me, since she never had a problem with sharing and even though she and Nora are not BFF's, they usually get along. After asking why, Amy started crying, saying that she never wanted a joint birthday party, and that I force her to share everything with Nora. They share a room for space and I make sure they're both invited to the same parties and sleepovers, so that Nora won't be left out. If they don't invite both of them, then either of them goes.

Amy stated that she at least wanted her own gifts to be hers alone. I scolded her for being selfish with her stepsister, grounded her and took a couple of the presents to give to Nora. She turned them down because she didn't want problems with Amy and it felt like pity. Since then, Amy has been cold to all of us. I just wanted my two girls to be closer with the joint party and have the same things. AITA?

We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>
Who likes to crash at our house with her friends. 

My wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.
My sister said it’s not her. I believe my sister. I just don’t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them.

Last week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy. 

My wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn’t enough for her and her friends.
They wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no.

They ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn’t want anyone else to have a key to our house.

I tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn’t “good enough” anymore.

My mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house.

My mom didn’t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn’t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile. 

Am I the A here? I feel like I have tried to right any wrongs that have happened. 
Between my wife and my sister.

Update* sorry I haven’t been able to reply the past couple of hours. I have been busy.

I talked to my mom again and let her know my sister isn’t allowed over without me home. 

I asked a friends wife who is a maid to come deep clean our home. So if/when my wife comes home it’s clean.

The last thing is my mom asked me to help cover my sisters cheer. She is on track for a scholarship. I told my mom I would pay half of my wife’s things were returned. If not the money was going to replace the stolen items.

Also my sister was invited to home coming. She wanted me to buy a dress. I told her no for not following our home rules and the money I saved for the dress is going to pay for the maid.

I did replace the locks again. I also am planning a romantic dinner I will make and clean up. I heard a lot about the cinnamon rolls. Someone on here gave me the idea to make them. I am for a dessert.

Update: my sister and my mom left a few mins ago. My sister had a bag of my wife’s things. More than I thought was gone. Most items are in poor shape.

The big thing is she had my wife’s grandmothers ring I thought was in the safe. I had no idea it was gone. My sister said that she found it on my wife’s night stand during the party. She forgot she had it on when she left our home. The ring isn’t valuable it’s just sentimental. I told my mom who the ring belonged to. My mom lost it. My sister is now grounded.

Last update tonight, my wife is coming home. I am staying at a friends house. Until we can work some of this out. 
I already stated it but I did put the locks back on my wife bought. My family doesn’t have that key.

Early morning update, My mom called my wife last night and asked what my sister can do to fix/ replace the damaged items.
My wife said “have her meet me every morning at 5 am.” I decided to tag along and see what my wife had planned. Trying to support her in whatever punishment she decides to do. You know the cinnamon rolls. My wife’s co-works 4 yr old is in the final stages of cancer. My wife’s plan is for my sister and her to prepare breakfast, get their other kids up and ready for the day. Start laundry, basic clean up. So her co-worker and his wife can spend as much time as he can with the sick child before work.

My sister was silent the whole time coming back home.
I can tell it really hit her that her life isn’t as hard. Even being grounded.

Last and final post, my wife has given me a second chance as long as I follow her list of rules.
1) for awhile no family at our home
2) no family borrowing our things. 
3)no one is allowed a key
4)I help with the chores around the house. Including cooking meals.
5) last My wife is ok with me seeing my sister but asked that we all go to counseling to understand why my sister is targeting her. 
My wife said all of this has been really hard and she doesn’t want to cause more issues but she just doesn’t trust my sister and can’t have her using out things.","AITA for changing the door locks back after my wife changed them?I <30M> have a beautiful wife who loves to serve others. We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>
Who likes to crash at our house with her friends. 

My wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.
My sister said it’s not her. I believe my sister. I just don’t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them.

Last week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy. 

My wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn’t enough for her and her friends.
They wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no.

They ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn’t want anyone else to have a key to our house.

I tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn’t “good enough” anymore.

My mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house.

My mom didn’t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn’t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile.

My wife and I had our babyboy 5 weeks ago. Everythibg's going fine, no health problems or complications whatsoever. However, my wife is often exhausted so I let my mom come over to help out with cleaning and stuff (I can barely have time to work) and also, at the same time, Spend time with the baby and bond with him a little bit.


Thing is my wife acts strange whenever she sees my mom with our son. She'd make a face and talk to her in a descending tone, even raises her voice at her causing mom to feel hurt. I asked my wife about it and she said it was because of what my mom is doing. I asked her to elaporate and she complained about mom holding the baby for long and taking forever to give him back to her. mom argued that my wife could ask nicely instead of outright yelling but my wife defended herself saying that she only starts raising her voice after she's already asked a couple of times and mom won't listen. They started arguing and mom started crying. that's when I felt enraged,  pulled my wife aside and told her to stop acting out and that if she keeps this up then we won't get anymore help from mom. She argued that she was trying to feed our son and that it was awful of me to think of it as ""acting out"". I said I understood her frustration and yes mom can do things that require some patience from us. but a little kindness can go a long way in keeping the peace in this difficult time. She called me selfish and said that it's easy for me to say when I'm not the one ""dealing with this"". from there the argument escalated despite me trying to cut it short. I went outside to calm down and after that my wife started cold shouldering me. I told her this was not okay but she told me to go sc*ew myself and that from now on out I should deal with taking our son back from my mom when it's time for feeding since I ""condone"" this behabior.

I really am not condoning anything and really think she's stressed out yes but the way she behaves around mom is, in my opinion, not okay.

My home’s been in my family for several generations. We have always been known for having a large, beautiful garden. We invited over kids to help with gardening, we gave away so many veggies, we’d hold parties, etc. It’s been a neighborhood treasure for years.

They said they didn’t know what I meant, so I asked if they’d ever looked in our backyard. They said yes and said they think the garden is cute.

I said “Yes, the garden that now has about half less sunlight than before that house was built was a neighborhood treasure.""

The guy said “Well it’s not our fault you built the garden there, is it?”

I said “Well, you guys got what you paid for. 2 million dollars for a house that everyone in the neighborhood hates.” I said that I hoped it was worth it and wished them a nice day.

When I told another neighbor about the exchange, she told me that she does feel bad for them moving without having any idea what they were getting themselves into.

He is handsome, smart, funny, well-educated, has an awesome job, and is a sweetheart. Sunday he had a whole day planned for us. We were going to walk a nature trail and then go back to his place for dinner he was making. I was so excited because it was going to be the first time I'd be at his house. Since we were hiking he said I could bring my dog Shelby with us.

He made us a roast and some vegetables for dinner. I finished my plate before Jay did and took it to the kitchen. There was still about half the roast left and it was close to Shelby's dinner time so I took half of the half of roast and some still raw vegetables from the fridge to put on a plate for Shelby. I was carrying the plate to the back door with Shelby to feed her outside and Jay asked me what I was doing. I told him feeding Shelby.

Jay said something like ""Well that's not dog food."" Jay knows I mainly feed Shelby a raw diet. I opened the door to put the plate down for Shelby and Jay got up, took the plate away from her, went to the kitchen and came back with it wrapped up in tinfoil and told me to leave. His excuse was that he made dinner for me and him, not me, him, and my dog and that I should've asked before I helped myself since he would've used his leftovers. I did leave but not before telling him that he made that meal for us so I could do with some of it as I pleased and he knew damn well how I feed Shelby. I tried talking to my friend about it later that night but she said Jay was right to be upset but this friend has never really approved of how I treat my own dog so I feel like she was probably a bit biased and the wrong person to ask.

AITA for just feeding my dog like I normally would?

Clarification: She does NOT get restaurant food daily, I eat out maybe 4 times a month. If what I eat is dog safe or the restaurant makes food for dogs on request, THEN I bring some home for her. Shelby's daily meals are a bit of brown rice, raw vegetables, and ground chicken hearts and beef livers. The hearts and livers are boiled just enough to kill bacteria and that is all with the approval of Shelby's vet. I asked Jay how he prepared the roast so I could know if it was safe to give her. That's also why I got her fresh, unused vegetables from the fridge.

Update: I accept that Im the AH for what I said and did to Jay. Some of these responses were harsh but I see now how and why I was entitled. Thanks to people that responded to the actual issue. Others going on about her diet, thanks for the concern? but I came here to ask about Jay. Not get into a debate about dog foods. Shelby's been on her diet for 6 years and is a healthy and active puppo, that's all I and my vet need to know. As for Jay, I apologized to him and he did accept my apology but he broke it off. He said it was the last straw for him over me doing things without asking first. He has talked to me about taking things off his plate or his drink without asking before. I've tried to do better but keep slipping up. I didn't realize I was that bad about it so I'm going to work on myself for the next guy. For people that said not going to his place for 4 months was a red flag, that was my decision that he respected.

Later I got several messages calling me an A for cutting down the aunts late husbands tree. I had no idea he planted the tree. Now my husband and his whole family are really angry at me. I never told them to remove the tree. I feel like I am being thrown under the bus here.

I run a team of about 6 people. Our company offers a large amount of maternity leave, 10 months. One of my employees got pregnant recently, i’ll call her Jess. 

Our team does project based work and in the period between her leaving for ML we finished up the project we were working on when she left, and started working on a project without her. 

During this period, our team had to adapt to working without her expertise in certain matters. We adapted and eventually some of us developed the skills needed to do some of her workload.

The situation we have now is me, and 2 others split half the work that Jess used to do, and we hired someone new to come in to the team to handle the other part of Jess’s workload and then some. 

This new employee came at significantly reduced cost, as he was straight out of Uni and we pay him a fraction of what Jess costs currently. 

Now Jess has come back to the team, but there is another issue. 

Our firm has informed us that for some fucking reason we no longer have the budget for a 7 person team, and will have to let someone go. This news came about when I submitted the paperwork for Jess’s return. 

We are 5 months into a project that should take an estimated 10 months, and my decision came down to Jess and the man we hired to replace her. The reason we hired a replacement, which is not normally what we do, is because we anticipated that for this project the workload would be far greater than our current capacity, which it is not. 

As you can tell by the title, I chose the replacement. I did so for the following reasons: 

* Far cheaper, thus freeing up a lot more money than keeping Jess on
* He was up to date with the project and we would be able to move forward seamlessly, whereas with Jess we would have to take time catching her up to speed on half the project
* The clients already knew and liked working with him, whereas they didn’t know Jess at all
* She has been out of the field for a prolonged period, whilst he has been here for the past 9 months, so she may, or may not, find it hard to adapt back to work life, whilst with him it isn’t a question
* He performed his work better than she did hers and interacted better with the team. 

Obviously, the ideal situation which I wanted was to keep both and not put a new single mother with no other job lined up out in the cold, but I had to do right by the team and firm. I told her I’d write her a brilliant Letter of Recommendation, and that in a few months she could try and apply for a job at our firm, hopefully we’ll have the budget, but she snapped at me and told me not to bother, and called me a cunt and left. 

I know I sound cold and heartless but I had to be fair to both employees, not just Jess, right?

I brought this up with Beth and she had an attitude and implied that I was just saying this and objecting because of how I feel about the situation not how our traditions should be practiced. We got into an argument and I went home.


Mike thinks I'm being unreasonable and possibly causing him to miss something so sentimental and that if anything, he feels honored to be asked to do this for her, and said that I should stop worrying about what others might say.

And sorry for the long post. 

My wife (39F) and I (42M) have three sons, Alex (15), Dylan (11), and Jake (8). When I was a kid I always wanted a dog but my parents said no. I never got the chance to get one during my twenties but recently my interest in owning one was sparked again so I asked my family what they thought about getting a dog. My wife wasn’t enthusiastic about it but she relented after a few weeks of me asking. Alex and Jake were excited to get one but Dylan was immediately opposed to the idea. 

Dylan was always different than my other sons, he never had an interest in sports and was always more subdued than his brothers which has always made it hard for me to connect with him. 

He remained opposed to the idea of getting a dog but me and my other sons managed to wear him down until he finally relented. However, he said that if we did get a dog, he wasn’t going to be interacting with it or taking care of it, that would be completely on me and his brothers. I found this ridiculous but i agreed in the moment hoping he would change his mind after meeting the dog. 

The problem is he hasn’t changed his mind yet. We’ve had Zeus for seven months now and Dylan has not warmed up to him in the slightest. 

He doesn’t play with the dog, he doesn’t cuddle with him, he doesn’t let Zeus into his room because he “destroys stuff” and whenever he is near the dog he just ignores him. I find this completely ridiculous. Zeus loves Dylan, he follows him around whenever he sees him and jumps on him to get his attention and play but Dylan just isn’t receptive to it.

To change this, I told Dylan last week that he would be in charge of walking the dog every day after school. Dylan straight up refused and has shut down the conversation every time I bring it up. It’s been a week and he hasn’t walked the dog once. 

In my frustration, I told him that if he didn’t start listening then I wouldn’t allow him to go to the comic book store anymore and he freaked and told my wife. Now, my wife is upset with me, claiming that I knew what I was getting into with this and I knew that Dylan wouldn’t be playing with the dog but his intolerance of the dog is weird and I refuse to entertain it any longer. 

My wife has been short with me ever since that conversation and Dylan is cold with me as well. Alex is now agreeing with his mother which is making me have second thoughts.

I apologized for how she felt but requested that she just do as asked. She got mad at me and said that I was being inconsiderate and she didn't understand my husband's hangup on what she and her husband do. We started arguing and she stormed off to the guests room where my nephew and BIL are.


She's not speaking to me but my husband said I did the right thing by speaking to her and setting this boundary.


AITA? Am I (and my husband) overreacted to this?


Some infos:

1. My husband did not mention hearing anything, just that he saw them get out of the bathroom. And yes they were clothed.

2. It's the only bathroom in the house.

3. They spent apprximately 10+ in the shower according to my husband.

EDIT* I'm gonna bring my husband to look at the responses and help answer some questions down here, okay? Just give me a few minutes.

Me (M32) and my wife, Dahlia (F28) lost our apartment 2 months ago and moved in with mom temporarily. Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise.


Fyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that! 

For example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out.


Last night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was ""bonkers"" because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some ""explicit"" picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such ""demand"" and be pushy still.


This morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable.


Anthony has been a friend of mine for 10 years. I wouldn't have asked to move in with him if I didn't have such strong bond with him. He himself constantly talks about all the things and situations I helped him out with and we are considered brothers.","AITA for asking my friend to move a picture of him and his wife because it made my wife uncomfortable?

My wife and I were invited to my brother's 31st birthday. He's single and lives alone in his apartment.

So to give you the headsup, my wife and him don't get along so well. But can be civil enough to sit at the same table.


So, we went and had dinner and talked and everything was going well, no argument nothing til after my wife went to use the bathroom. Later my brother went to use the bathroom then came back looking pissed. He kept giving me and my wife looks but I didn't know what was going on til he pulled me aside before we left and told me that my wife had left her used pad in his bathroom. I was shocked and didn't know what to say because this felt highly inappropriate. He said he didn't appreciate what my wife did and that it was a sign of disrespect towards him. I apologized profoundly and said I didn't know about it. He asked me to speak to her or she wouldn't be welcome in his place anymore.


We got in the car and I asked my wife about it, she nonchantly said there was nothing wrong with what she did and that my brother was being ridiculous. I kind of flipped and told her it was very inappropriate for her to leave her used pad in his place even if it was in the bathroom and in the trashcan because it made him uncomfortable. She yelled asking what she was supoosed to do and I told her she could've took it with her and threw it outside not in his bathroom -- that's my brother's place and he told me how he felt about it. She yelled at me calling my brother an incel and me an asshole for ""getting in her face about it"". She said she needed to use the bathroom and it's not like the pad was vidible since she dumped it in the trashcan.


At home we still argued about it and she kept on calling me and my brother names. She's currently not speaking to me and is avoiding me entirely. Regardless, I feel like it's his place and he gets to express what makes him uncomfortable in it.


EDIT. I can't give info or expand on what was seen but I can tell you that the trash can does not have a lid. It's not like one of those trashcans that have a lid on top and you can push it. What I want to emphasize on is the fact that as guests we should respect people's homes and not argue about what makes them uncomfortable.

My wife is a grade A+ picky eater. It's bothersome to a certain degree but on holidays basically the shitshow begins. She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them.


As a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event.

She started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the ""perfect compromise"".


Update: And so, my wife has decided to go spend thankgiving with her family (who by the way live HOURS away, so this means unnecesary travel expenses) instead and basically ditch me for a whole week. Y'all happy now? Though I appreciate some insightful comments on the situation. Some others?.....not so much especially with those assumptions claiming that my wife has allergies, SHE DOES NOT!

Context: For every holiday, My mother would ask the women in the family (my sisters, sister in-law, my wife, my female cousins) to send ""samples"" of the desserts they plan to bring to the celebration for testing and to see if these desserts could make it to the ""food menu"". My wife has been complaining about my mother deliberately rejecting every dessert sample she sent. So many times my mother has told her that she's being honest and keeping the guests best interest at heart. Yet my wife still thought that my mother is deliberately excluding her since 2 of her dessert samples were rejected before.



For this year's Christmas my mother is doing the same thing but this time, she told every woman who are participating to make a ""cookie sample"" and send it to her for testing. My wife took it as a challenge and to be honest she worked really hard to make a good sample and sent it to my mother days ago and the results just came in yesterday.


I came home from work and found my wife upset. I asked what's wrong and she told me that my mother rejected the sample she sent and decided to exclude her baking from the food list/menu for christmas this year. I didn't know what to say but she then told me she was backing out of the invitation to attend christmas with my family. I was stunned when I heard her make this statement. I tried to talk to her but she said ""it was done"" I called her unreasonable to decide to bail on the whole family over some cookie sample...that's just freaking crazy and quite unreasonable. We had a full on argument about it and she stated that my mother caused this but I told her that my mother is pretty serious and careful about the food she offers to the guests since we are going to have relatives coming from all sides of country. She told me to stop mentioing it.


Later I heard her cry despite telling her that her baking is amazing and people have preferences that's all.



AITA for insisting that her decision was unreasonable?


Info. If you're asking whose cookie sample made it to the menu, the answer is my sister and my 2 cousins.


Info Few things to put on here:

1. My wife wasn't the only one whose sample was rejected. We have SIL's (brother's wife) and my younger sister's.

2. My mother did not force anyone to participate, it was up to whoever wanted to take part.

3. This is just about the dessert since my mother tends to be very careful in this category but for other types of foods. Dishes/appetizers/salads/stuff like that is welcome as she stated.


Update: Great!, so I just got off the phone with my brother and he told me that his wife is doing the same thing as my wife and that she has decided to back out of the invitation to spend christmas with family as well. Turns out my wife must've told her about her decision and she decided to follow her lead. My brother is pissed saying my wife is encouraging his wife to do this.

We spent the day in an area that’s known to have a lot of rich/famous people and towards the end of the day we saw one of my daughter’s favorite celebrities (we’ll call her A) walking out of a store. 

My daughter ran to the store but when she got near A, she was stopped by A’s security. They said that A’s there with her daughter for her daughter’s birthday and wants to focus on her daughter. 

My daughter was very upset because she’s been a fan of A for a very long time so she tried again for a picture but was turned away. 

My daughter was crushed so later that night I made a post talking about my experience with A. How she wouldn’t let anyone go near her and her daughter, the fact that her security was rude, and her not being willing to stop for a couple seconds for a picture. I understand it’s her daughter’s birthday but a 1 minute interaction with a fan isn’t going to ruin her day and if it does, that girl needs to learn that the world doesn’t revolve around her. 

The post ended up getting a lot of attention and a lot of people actually said my daughter and I were being entitled for expecting A to interrupt her daughter’s birthday for everyone that wants a picture.

AITA for making the post about A","AITA for making a post about my daughter’s favorite celebrity being rude to us?My daughter and I were recently on vacation. We spent the day in an area that’s known to have a lot of rich/famous people and towards the end of the day we saw one of my daughter’s favorite celebrities (we’ll call her A) walking out of a store. 

My daughter ran to the store but when she got near A, she was stopped by A’s security. They said that A’s there with her daughter for her daughter’s birthday and wants to focus on her daughter. 

My daughter was very upset because she’s been a fan of A for a very long time so she tried again for a picture but was turned away. 

My daughter was crushed so later that night I made a post talking about my experience with A. How she wouldn’t let anyone go near her and her daughter, the fact that her security was rude, and her not being willing to stop for a couple seconds for a picture. I understand it’s her daughter’s birthday but a 1 minute interaction with a fan isn’t going to ruin her day and if it does, that girl needs to learn that the world doesn’t revolve around her. 

The post ended up getting a lot of attention and a lot of people actually said my daughter and I were being entitled for expecting A to interrupt her daughter’s birthday for everyone that wants a picture.

My wife goes all out for my birthday parties and I love them. She’s more of a stoic introvert so I thought it would be nice to throw her a surprise 30th birthday with just her and me and make it a special event. I wanted to make her a gift she would love.

I told her a week before her birthday that I had made plans with Jimmy. I have a job with flexible hours so it’s not uncommon for me to do it.  She wasn’t upset or anything. When her birthday came, it was all I could do not to say anything. When she left for work, I put my plan in action. I decorated the place. I brought out the cake. I learned from youtube and stored it at our friend’s house. I got a dozen bouquets of flowers. I got her a few other gifts too.

She seemed sad. She wasn’t smiling or energetic. I wanted to take her home and show her my gift so she would be happy. I came over to her and told her she had to come home. We grabbed her things and left. On the uber back, she didn’t say anything. At home she started crying.

However we've run up against a conflict.

She's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast.

Meanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning.

However my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her ""no"" but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her.

She seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return.

I f26 was invited to my sister's (18th) birthday few days ago at a restaurant. My husband didn't come because he said he had a meeting dinner with some clients. This made my family feel let down especially my sister who wanted him there and also her 18th birthday was a big deal to her obviously.



To my surprise, When I arrived I noticed that my husband was having his meeting at the same place, his table was right in the corner and he had about 4 men sitting with him. My parents and the guests saw him as well. I waved for him and he saw me but ignored me. He obviously was as much as surprised as I was.



My parents asked why he didn't even come to the table to acknowledge them after the cake arrived. I got up and walked up to his table. I stood there and said excuse me, my husband was silent when I asked (after I introduced myself to the clients) if he'd take few minutes to join me and the family in candle blowing and say happy birthday but he barely let out a phrase and said ""I don't think so, I'm busy right now"". I insisted saying it'd just take a couple of minutes and that it'd mean so much to my sister. He stared at me then stared awkwardly back at his clients. They said nothing and he got up after my parents were motionning for me to hurry up.


He sat with us while my sister blew the candles and cut the cake. My parents insisted he takes a piece and join us in the selfie but he got up and walked back to his table looking pissed. We haven't talked til we met later at home.


He was upset and starred scolding me infront of my parents saying I embarrassed him and made him look unprofessional and ruined his business meeting. I told him he overreacted since it only took few minutes and it was my sister's birthday and my family wanted him to join since he was literally in the same restaurant. He called me ignorant and accused me of tampering with his work but I responded that ignoring mine and my family's presence was unacceptable.


We argued then he started stone walling me and refusing to talk to me at all.


FYI) I didn't have an issue with him missing the event, but after seeing that he was already there then it become a different story.

Also it literally took 5-7 minutes. He didn't even eat nor drink. Just sat down and watched.","AITA for asking my husband to join us in my sister's birthday since he was in the same restaurant?

**EDIT #1**



I was banned from commenting within the first hour because I violated a rule in a comment and that's why I wasn't responding to anyone. I'm a fairly new Reddit user in terms of posting - I normally read a lot and that's all - and because of this, I had no clue that a temporary comment ban didn't affect my ability to edit the post. I would have edited the post much sooner had I known I was able to regardless of the comment ban.

There are so many things that need to be addressed about this post and the most important one is about my wife. I love her more than anyone on Reddit thinks I do. She is an amazing woman and a wonderful mother. I absolutely DO NOT think she is an incompetent parent nor do I think she neglects my son. None of the information I provided was ever supposed to convey that negative message about her.

My whole issue was: ""he's awake, he's been awake, why are you still asleep?"" - that's all, and she agreed she stays up too late plus has alarms set now.

I showed my wife how this post EXPLODED and she COULD NOT believe the kind of attention it got. She is very much in love with me and does not agree that I am controlling nor does she believe that I am micromanaging her daily life.

Also, because so many people believe that I intentionally left out the medical issues she has, I'll list them here:

- postpartum depression
- low vitamin B-12
- chronic fatigue

Now, let me explain why I didn't list them originally.

Her low vitamin B-12 is not a deficiency, her level is just lower than what is considered ""best"" for her age; this is according to recent bloodwork that I recommended. The results state that any number between 100 pg/mL and 914 pg/mL is ""within normal range"", and her level is 253 pg/mL. The doctor suggested sublingual B-12 1000mcg daily to raise the level a little, but stated that apart from that, she could not find a reason for the chronic fatigue. Because of these results, and especially after purchasing the supplements, in my mind, the B-12 is not a problem. Also, the bloodwork confirmed that everything else was normal.

The postpartum depression is actively being monitored and treated by a professional. My wife literally goes to a psychiatrist, or psychologist (I can't remember their exact title) multiple times a year and we pay for medication every 30 days. She initially tried depression medication, followed the regimen religiously and not much changed for her. This was addressed in a following appointment and a new medication was prescribed. Her current medication is normally used to treat ADHD or narcolepsy and the doctor believed it would alleviate some of her tiredness and release more dopamine thus providing more energy in her daily life. This does seem to be true and she seems to be happy with the medicine.

The chronic fatigue is a result of her own poor scheduling and personal health. She has agreed that she spends too much time sitting and using the phone. She naps when our son naps and has trouble falling asleep at a normal bedtime hour due to this daytime sleep. We always go to bed together and he's told me multiple times that she moved to the living room after I fell asleep because she couldn't sleep and was bored just lying there. Then, midnight or later comes, she's finally drowsy and decides to sleep. However, the overstimulation from social media and phone usage makes it difficult for her brain to reach REM sleep normally. So she falls asleep at 12:00, our son wakes up at 8:00, eight hours have passed and she still feels tired and not at all rested.

I do know and have known about her condition. We have agreed to disagree about the cause of her sleeping problems. In her mind she has chronic fatigue because of insomnia and it's a vicious cycle. In my mind she stays up too late on the phone and doesn't get the sleep her body needs.

Whether the internet thinks she is a bad mother, negligent, lazy or abusive is not important. I know and love the woman I married, I do feel comfortable leaving her with our kid and she does an amazing job with him. In a few comments I stated that she was lazy and didn't do much at home. I won't deny those statements, but in the moment I was still aggravated because the argument over the phone had just recently ended. I don't truly think she's lazy because I've seen what she can do; I just think she's unmotivated due to a lack of sleep and the same four walls every day.

Finally, I am not spying on her or my son. We only have two cameras in this house and both are in our son's room. One camera provides a wide-angle view of the entire room and the other is positioned directly above his crib. The cameras serve no purpose during the day because I'd barely be able to hear background noise from another room even if I did try to listen in.

My wife is an amazing woman and an amazing mother. My son is just so happy all the time, he's super smart, full of energy and extremely healthy. I will not be hiring a nanny or using a daycare. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what my wife does during the day, I just wish she'd start her day earlier for my little man.

I want to say thank you to everyone who commented on this post and messaged me. My wife and I had a long, in-depth conversation last night after all of the attention this post received and I've shown her everything. There were tears, much more laughs and a lot of things to think about.

I think the most important thing we learned is that so many people are quick to judge and that in itself is a very big problem.



**EDIT #2**



I need to make it clear that my wife does not have narcolepsy. She is not taking medicine for narcolepsy. I said that the medicine she takes now is USUALLY used to treat narcolepsy or ADHD. She also does not have ADHD.

We always go to bed together and he's told me multiple times that she moved to the living room after I fell asleep because she couldn't sleep and was bored just lying there. Then, midnight or later comes, she's finally drowsy and decides to sleep. However, the overstimulation from social media and phone usage makes it difficult for her brain to reach REM sleep normally. So she falls asleep at 12:00, our son wakes up at 8:00, eight hours have passed and she still feels tired and not at all rested.

I do know and have known about her condition. We have agreed to disagree about the cause of her sleeping problems. In her mind she has chronic fatigue because of insomnia and it's a vicious cycle. In my mind she stays up too late on the phone and doesn't get the sleep her body needs.

Whether the internet thinks she is a bad mother, negligent, lazy or abusive is not important. I know and love the woman I married, I do feel comfortable leaving her with our kid and she does an amazing job with him. In a few comments I stated that she was lazy and didn't do much at home. I won't deny those statements, but in the moment I was still aggravated because the argument over the phone had just recently ended. I don't truly think she's lazy because I've seen what she can do; I just think she's unmotivated due to a lack of sleep and the same four walls every day.

Finally, I am not spying on her or my son. We only have two cameras in this house and both are in our son's room. One camera provides a wide-angle view of the entire room and the other is positioned directly above his crib. The cameras serve no purpose during the day because I'd barely be able to hear background noise from another room even if I did try to listen in.

My wife is an amazing woman and an amazing mother. My son is just so happy all the time, he's super smart, full of energy and extremely healthy. I will not be hiring a nanny or using a daycare. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what my wife does during the day, I just wish she'd start her day earlier for my little man.

I want to say thank you to everyone who commented on this post and messaged me. My wife and I had a long, in-depth conversation last night after all of the attention this post received and I've shown her everything. There were tears, much more laughs and a lot of things to think about.

I think the most important thing we learned is that so many people are quick to judge and that in itself is a very big problem.



**EDIT #2**



I need to make it clear that my wife does not have narcolepsy. She is not taking medicine for narcolepsy. I said that the medicine she takes now is USUALLY used to treat narcolepsy or ADHD. She also does not have ADHD.

My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat.

He suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu.

I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat.

He suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu.

AITA?

Over that time my friends circle got considerably smaller but my best friend remained, Mia (f31). Mia doesn’t have kids nor wants kids but she’s been brilliant with Ciara.

I’m a SAHM and obviously don’t have as much time to hang out as I did previously. Mia and I live on the same street (we’re in Manchester, England) and it’s a walking distance between our houses. I’ve told Mia numerous times that she can just pop in whenever she wants to (she works from home) but she rarely does. 

She did at the beginning but it’s been happening less and less. Instead, she keeps suggesting we go out for coffee or pizza or even a drink but I don’t have the time and always just tell her to come over and we’ll have coffee at my place.

She asked if I wanted to go out with her and her other friends for a drink last weekend but I said that no but she’s welcome to come over and we’ll have a few drinks at mine. She said she already had plans and it felt weird to drink when she knows there’s a child around. 

Honestly, I feel neglected. I feel like she put me on a back burner and doesn’t want to be friends anymore. I’m always available but she rarely comes over and I don’t think that’s fair.

Today, I saw her photos from Saturday night out and I was fuming. She ditched me just so she could go and drink like she’s 20 again. I felt rejected and horrible, I thought we were best friends but she clearly doesn’t value me when she won’t even have a few drinks with me at my house.

When she finished work, she called and asked if I fancied going for coffee to town but I asked her to come over again. She said yes but before she disconnected, I heard her mumble “like always.” This really annoyed me.

When she came over, I decided to be open about everything. And while not my proudest or most mature moment, I shouted at her that she’s an awful friend m, that she barely comes over and if she doesn’t want to spend time with me to just say it and stop playing around.

She said she’s always been accommodating but it’s been 2 years and she doesn’t want to spend time with me when there’s always a kid, especially now when she has to watch her language (Mia likes to swear).

I said that she knew I had a child and responsibilities. And she said that Tom (my partner) could take care of Ciara once in a while so I could have a time off.

This felt really intrusive and I told her to mind her own business and not meddle on my marriage. 

I was really angry with her and kicked her out. She called me a selfish asshole on her way out.

I like you and all, but I've known her for over 12 years and she's one of the most important people in my life. You'll have to be ok with that if you want us to be a thing.""

He had his cry for a couple days, he gets to be done with mourning her already. There's no need for him to go to her funeral, since I wouldn't want her at his.

Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies). 


On Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes. 

When I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art. 

My niece avoided me for the vast majority of the party after that. I tried to make her feel better by displaying her gift on my living room cabinet, but my wife pulled me aside later in the day and told me to take it down after the party because it was in her words, ""really ugly"" and made her uncomfortable.

Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies). 


On Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes. 

When I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art.

Our daughter had to work Christmas, but we did Christmas on the 26th and she stayed with us for the holidays from then until yesterday. Our son still lives with us, and today he told us both that he didn't want to say anything while his sister was here, but his feelings were hurt by the disparity in the value of the gifts. We explained that the gifts we got him were tailored to his interests, but his sister has just passed a big life milestone where money is more important to her right now than sentiment. He said it's still hurtful because it feels like we are more proud of her than him.

My wife got really frustrated when he said that and asked why he would choose the least charitable interpretation of our actions. He said that's just how he felt and he couldn't control it. I said that we didn't give her money because we were more proud, but because we had experience being new homeowners and knowing that something always breaks in that first six months and it's always expensive.

My wife really likes watching scary movies but I have never enjoy them. I get too scared and end up having a bad time so I prefer to avoid them. Her friends sometimes go with her to the more popular ones but she also likes older, indies and foreign horror movies. She has always had a hard time finding people that have this niche interest and that is why it was such a big deal when we met Walter and found out he also shares this tendency. They very quickly started to make plans to watch movies together. I was invited to be a part of this but refused.

I prefer to just stay at home babysitting Emily and Walter's daughter while they are in their cinephile reunions. Sometimes they go to movie theaters but other times they just stay at Walter's place watching stuf at his home cinema. They usually have to go to another town in order to catch a specific function of some weird movie so it is normal for them to come back very late.

They eventually started doing stuff outside of watching movies, like going out for dinner. Walter invited all of us, including the kids, to go with him to a restaurant that a friend of him owned but I said no because it was too expensive. I don't like that kind of places because I feel they are a waste of money and didn't think the kids would enjoy it either. I insisted on staying with the kids and let the two of them go be themselves. This has became a regular thing and it is in a way a good deal for me because Walter pays for my wife's dinner and she can't no longer complain about me not taking her to fancy restaurants.

As both their movie and dinner nights had became so common, I have grown a little tired of the burden of constantly babysitting the girls. I talk to my wife and Walter about it and he explained that he usually does not like leaving his duaghters with babysitters. He says he is really comfortable knowing that they are being watched by an experienced father like me instead of some teenage girl. He nevertheless agreed that it was too much of a load for me and offered to start paying me a standard babysitter fee each time he goes out with my wife.

I thought that was a fair approach to the issue but my wife was fully against it. She says I should not be paid for babysitting my own daughter nor the daughters of a close friend of our family like Walter. We have been arguing about this but she insists on this notion and it not open to change. She even gets mad every time I talk to her about this.

I don't like that kind of places because I feel they are a waste of money and didn't think the kids would enjoy it either. I insisted on staying with the kids and let the two of them go be themselves. This has became a regular thing and it is in a way a good deal for me because Walter pays for my wife's dinner and she can't no longer complain about me not taking her to fancy restaurants.

As both their movie and dinner nights had became so common, I have grown a little tired of the burden of constantly babysitting the girls. I talk to my wife and Walter about it and he explained that he usually does not like leaving his duaghters with babysitters. He says he is really comfortable knowing that they are being watched by an experienced father like me instead of some teenage girl. He nevertheless agreed that it was too much of a load for me and offered to start paying me a standard babysitter fee each time he goes out with my wife.

I thought that was a fair approach to the issue but my wife was fully against it. She says I should not be paid for babysitting my own daughter nor the daughters of a close friend of our family like Walter. We have been arguing about this but she insists on this notion and it not open to change. She even gets mad every time I talk to her about this. Walter promised me that he will convince her but he does not seem to have been able to do so either.

When the kids were young, my parents set up education funds for both of them, which was very generous of them.

My wife and I always expected our kids to attend college and then graduate school, as we have done. I have a PhD, my wife has a master's. Because of this, we decided not to use the funds for our kids' undergrad degrees and did not tell them about the money.

My daughter has always been more into the liberal arts, while my son is more of a STEM guy. My wife and I worried about her ability to find a job, but she insisted on studying music and film in college. She was accepted to some top schools and chose to attend a rather expensive one, but she had scholarships to cover almost all of her tuition. Everything else, plus living expenses, was her responsibility. She lived in a very small apartment shared with friends in a not-so-nice area far from campus, but she was fine and learned how to budget effectively. After graduating, she luckily found a job that doesn't pay extremely well but she enjoys, and scrapped the idea of grad school.

My son decided to do engineering, and he also expressed that he had no interest in grad school. My wife and I were disappointed, but accepted it since at this point he is already all set up with a very good job when he completes school. Since he did not receive as many scholarships as his sister, we decided to use his education fund to cover his tuition and living expenses. He was able to get a large and nice apartment of his own close to the school, which is important since his classes are so demanding and he needs a comfortable space to work.

My daughter was confused and asked how he could afford this, and he told her about the education fund. She called us and asked why she didn't have one, and we told her she did, we just didn't use it because we hoped she would attend grad school. She seemed hurt by this and asked if there was any way she could have the money now. We explained that there would be a fee to simply withdraw the money for non-education uses, and if we chose to do that it would belong to her grandparents so they could put it towards their own use. She's been quiet and short when answering our texts, and hasn't answered our calls at all since then. I know that it seems unfair to her, but it's not really her money in the first place and she's no longer in college. Plus, her brother only received it for educational purposes and it wouldn't be right for her to just have it to spend now. AITA?

UPDATE: I understand the consensus is that my wife and I are the AH. I texted my daughter to ask if she wanted us to withdraw the money for her/what she wanted to do. This was her response: ""I don't care. Maybe they can transfer it to \[other grandkid who is 5\] if the fee is seriously too much. Idk about grad school I haven't thought about it much recently. If I do apply it wouldn't be for another couple years and I hadn't been counting on having any financial help in the first place so it really doesn't even matter. Thanks for asking tho.""

UPDATE 2: My wife and I are discussing our daughter's response and our next actions to resolve this situation. For context, my wife has always had a strained relationship with my daughter and did not approve of many of her life choices. She believes we should take our daughter's words at face value and assume she no longer wants the money. From some of the responses here, I fear that my daughter's response was out of resentment and I suggested taking out as much money as her brother was given so at least they received the same amount. She could use it responsibly towards rent, groceries, transportation, etc. or in some other way to further her career, so it would still be for ""educational"" purposes in a sense. My wife is standing firm in her opinion, and we will continue talking it through tomorrow. 

Many have asked about where my parents stand on this. At this point, they are not mentally aware enough to really participate in the discussion. They did know about our grad school stipulation and thought it was fine. They also knew that we took out some money for our son once we were certain he was not pursuing an advanced degree, and were fine with that as well. They said it was our decision as parents what to do with our daughter's fund, and they would support whatever we decided for her. It wouldn't be useful to ask them what to do with it now, but I have always said that whatever is unused will go back to their care. I have tried to call my daughter with no luck, which is why I sent the text. Despite what many have said here, I hope this does not end our relationship.

My sis N has always had a strained relationship with our parents especially my mom. I am clearly not privy to the reasons because things are fine with me and my parents. When N went to college she met her creative writing professor as a freshman and they got close immediately. They would do a lot together and worked closely on a few different writing projects. N never specifically said this, but it was obvious to anyone who saw them interact that they had a substitute mother/daughter type relationship. Which hurt my mom a lot to see. I always thought she'd grow out of it or that the prof would move on but ten years later they were still very close. 

About a month ago the prof died unexpectedly and it devastated N. She was really dperessed over the holidays which of course was all in front of my mom and was a difficult reminder that N loved the prof as a mother way more than she ever loved my mom as a mother. She still talks to my parents and stuff and they don't fight or anything but N is very distant and doesn't tell them anything about her life beyond the bare minimum. My mom tried to comfort N but N was doing her distant thing and didn't want comfort. 

Something unfortunate that happened to N is that when she got the call that she died, she was brewing tea and in the shock of the news she spilled boiling water on her arm which burned her kinda badly on her wrist. I think the burn was like on the borderline of 2nd and 3rd degree, and definitely still looked pretty rough during the holidays. N said it was especially hard because in addition to the physical pain, every time she looks at it she is reminded of the moment she found out the prof died. Which I totally get.

I was on facetime with N and she said she talked to her tattoo artist friend who said that the burn should be able to heal well enough to get a tattoo over it. N then excitedly told me about her idea which is a type of flower that the prof gave her a bouquet of for her undergrad graduation. My mom was so embarrassed that day because she didn't get N flowers but the prof did and N was parading them around so happy and it was a reminder of their connection. I guess N and the prof exchanged these flowers for every special occasion like birthdays etc.

So now she wants to get a decent sized tattoo in a highly visible spot of something that will remind everyone of the prof. I told N that this seemed really cruel to my mom who already feels cast aside and like she's in exile from N. And that's without the constant permanent reminder. N kind of scoffed and said ""I can't believe you think you have the right to tell me not to do this,"" called me an ass and hung up and is still not talking to me except for a very brief text saying congrats for a promotion I just got. My parents aren't commenting. My dad said I should have just kept quiet even though he agrees and my mom made no comment but seemed grateful I stood up for her.

My roommate has an elderly cat. The cat is honestly kinda mean, she doesn’t like me or my girlfriend and will run away if we try to pet her or pick her up. So we just avoid each other.

My roommate asked if we had cats prior to moving in because she said her cat “doesn’t like other cats.” We did not have any pets at the time so it worked out. We did tell her that we might want one someday to which she said we would have to revisit the issue if it came up.

Well, my girlfriend and I have gotten to a place where we really want a pet of our own. We saw a kitten at the shelter and just fell in love with him. We got the okay from our landlord and brought him home last week! His name is Banana Pudding! :)

Our roommate is furious with us. She told us that we were aware that her cat doesn’t like other cats. I told her honestly that it’s unfair for us to have to tiptoe around her cat and that we were allowed to have our own pets as long as the landlord is okay with it (which he is). She couldn’t expect us to never get a pet or to cater to her cat’s needs 24/7. The conversation ended there. 

Unfortunately things have escalated because her cat hisses and swats at Banana Pudding just for existing. She is honestly pretty aggressive which is a big issue imo. Our kitten is very friendly and sweet and causes no problems.

We asked our roommate that she keep her cat in her bedroom since she’s elderly and aggressive. She refused and hasn’t been speaking to us. She says we are huge AHs and even got some mutual friends to take her side. I personally think that if her cat is so aggressive and uncomfortable, it’s her responsibility to live alone. It’s gotten so bad that my girlfriend is crying and considering taking the kitten back to the shelter. So here I am to get an outside perspective because idk what to think now.

EDIT: So I am definitely the AH. The comments have really helped me to understand that my roommate’s cat is just acting… well, like a cat! I am willing to admit I was ignorant and impulsive. I have never had a pet before and should have done more research before jumping into pet ownership. I plan to sincerely apologize to my roommate. She is willing to talk once she gets home from work. I am going to see if she’s willing to try a proper introduction for both kitties and Banana Pudding will be staying in our room for the duration while her kitty will be able to roam. I am hopeful that things will work out and I want to thank everyone for being blunt and educating me. I was impulsive and inconsiderate, but my roommate is a great person and I think she will forgive us and be willing to try to make it work.

As years went by, they started reconciling and seeing each other more often. He invited us to his wedding which took place days ago.

We got there and the atmesphere was great, Until later when I found out that Jordan had denied Natalie a mother-son dance and instead chose his aunt to dance with him. Natalie told me this minutes later and I couldn't help feel irritated and quite upset. I decided to get up and leave and we both left. I got calls from my family after they saw me leave. And Jordan called later and I told him why I did it. He got mad and said it was his wedding and that his aunt is basically a mother to him and said that Natalie shouldn't expect ""special treatment"". I said it's not special treatmrnt but a tradition. Besides that he hurt her feelings for no reason other than for the sake of being malicious. He got offended and accused me of ruining his day and causing a scene.

I (52f) have three sons ages ranging from 13 to 20. My oldest son (20m) has a girlfriend (19f) that hands around our house a lot... It's a really small house and doesn't have a lot of space. She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap.

It is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household.

Yesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with the jug water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: ""Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated.""

I found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything.

Edit: Thanks for all the comments. I have spoken to my son about the issue, and you all made me realize that it was deeper than just the water. I showed him this post and explained that it's not her, it's me. I think she reacted that way when I initially told her off for filling up the bottle because--and my son helped me realize this, too--I was never really nice to her to begin with, in the course of their three year relationship (in my defense, she only started hanging around our house a lot about six months ago because she got a license). 

We called her on the phone this morning and I apologized for my reaction to the bottle. I explained I didn't mean to make her feel bad about the water--it really wasn't that big of a deal, and I feel silly for making it a big deal. She apologized for having an attitude and explained how she can feel a little defensive around me sometimes. I told her and my son that I will work on my attitude. My husband still thinks she was being disrespectful but I explained that I'm the reason she felt the need to act that way in the first place. It's not my choice who my son decided to date and I need to respect his choice. I think she is a sweet girl, and I feel horrible for the way I have been treating her. Again, thank you to everyone for making me realize my mistake.

I (52f) have three sons ages ranging from 13 to 20. My oldest son (20m) has a girlfriend (19f) that hands around our house a lot... It's a really small house and doesn't have a lot of space. She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap.

It is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household.

Yesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with the jug water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: ""Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated.""

I found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything.

She has seen them before and I don't think she really likes them very much but she knows I love them so she doesn't really say anything besides they aren't really her thing.

When we started the second movie, she opened a bottle of wine and proceeded to drink the whole thing, while still sitting on her phone. I was pretty irritated at this point because she wasn't even paying attention at all. 

The third movie started and by then she had opened another bottle of wine and was asleep within the first twenty minutes. I was really mad at that point and just left and went home. 

A few hours later I got a text asking where I went. I told her I was mad that she couldn't pay attention to my favorite movies on my birthday. She told me I was an asshole and to grow the hell up. I've texted her a couple times but she hasn't responded. AITA?

The problem is my place is under some construction and not an ideal place to be right now, so I’ve been staying with my girlfriend. My girlfriend suggested that we host my colleagues here since she has the space and thinks it’ll be fun. I told her I planned on skipping my rotation and seeing if the next person would be okay with hosting early. She kept pressing on why I didn’t want them over here, so I finally said it’s because her home decor is strange and not something a grown woman would have, and also that her insect wall horrified the one colleague that did come over. 

My girlfriend got mad and said at the end of the day, it’s not my space and these things bring her joy. She also said that she is indeed an adult woman, which is exactly why her apartment is decorated in such a manner. 

I love my girlfriend, I do. And it’s okay to have different interests. But does an adult really need to decorate with them besides a few things here and there? I mean, my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time.

I went home and had my son. I also made sure to get child support. He could afford it. He did fight it though. I had to prove paternity and everything. 

Through that his parents found out. They are well off. They have met my son and they truly do seem to love him. They have provided gifts for his birthday and Christmas. They helped me with extra money so I could complete my university without going into debt. They have taken us on vacation with them so they could spend time with him. They aren't my biggest fans but we are cordial to each other. 

Three months ago my son's father passed away. He got drunk at his bachelor party, tripped on the sidewalk, and hit his head. And that was all she wrote. 

My son and I attended the funeral. We spent a week in that city so his grandparents could see him. 

They approached me with an offer. They had no other children or grandchildren. Their son was only 28 so he had lots of time to provide them legitimate kids (they did not say this I'm just assuming) so they never thought about my son's name. 

They said that if I changed his surname to theirs legally they would make him their primary heir. I think this is dumb. He is their only grandchild and they would deny him an inheritance because of his last name? 

I said I would consider it, to be polite, and have left it at that. I actually have a pretty good life as it is. My family has been very supportive. And because of the whole court thing my son's father had to have life insurance with him as the beneficiary. 

Would it be nice for my kid to get a big sum of money. Yes. Do I want him to have the surname of a man who didn't want him, see him, or love him? No. 

I have been talking to my family about it and a few of them think I'm being an asshole for giving up.this kind of money for my son. It is generational wealth and I'm making the decision based on emotion. I think they are assholes for thinking money is the only thing that matters. 

I think I will tell my son's grandparents that they can talk to him about it when he is 16. He will be old enough to understand the implications but young enough not to be tied professionally to his last name.","WIBTA If I don't change my son's name even though it may cause him to lose an inheritance?I (24) got pregnant while I was taking a gap year traveling. I met an older guy, nothing gross, I was 19 he was 23. We had fun. I was working in a bar to make money while I explored his city. 

When I got pregnant he lost interest really quickly. I understood but I am pro choice. And I chose not to terminate. 

I went home and had my son. I also made sure to get child support. He could afford it. He did fight it though. I had to prove paternity and everything. 

Through that his parents found out. They are well off. They have met my son and they truly do seem to love him. They have provided gifts for his birthday and Christmas. They helped me with extra money so I could complete my university without going into debt. They have taken us on vacation with them so they could spend time with him. They aren't my biggest fans but we are cordial to each other.

My GF and I got take out from an Indian restaurant we like and order from usually when our budget allows us. This place is really the only good Indian place anywhere near us  but it is very pricey, and so we try to keep our order small (1 entree for me, 1 entree for her, and a side of naan bread that we share). The thing is, the side of bread isnt very much, and the entree just isnt the same without it. So it seriously annoys me when she eats the bread without dipping it in her curry. Its such a waste of the little bread that we get. I told her this before but says its not my concern how she eats her food. Except it is my concern because she is wasting a SHARED side. Whatever, I let it go each time. 

This time she didnt order curry like she usually does, she got biryani (rice and meat) so I was happy that I would get the bread to myself. While we were eating, she reaches over for the bread and eats a piece on its own. I got annoyed and moved the bread away from her and told her she doesnt need the bread  since she isnt eating a curry and doesnt need bread whereas I am eating a curry so I do need bread, also that her entree comes with rice and she can eat that. She got offended and ended up threatening not to pay her share for the food next time. She also called me a greedy asshole and took her food and ate the rest in our bedroom.

My friends are split, one of them says I'm in the right and it's too much carbs for one meal for her to have bread and rice, but the  other friend essentially also called me a greedy asshole. Its been hours and she's ignoring me. AITA?","AITA for not letting my GF eat the naan bread we ordered?

It's been pointed out my title wording makes the post seem worse than it is, I apologize for that, it wasn't my intention.

So, I've always known my son had an interest in men. He was slow on the pick up of incognito mode, and from the searches he made, I figured he was at least ""Bi-curious"" (if that's the proper term for it) since he hit puberty. Well, last year, he started bringing a boy around, and it was obvious they were dating, to the point I figured that he knew I knew, and it wanst a big deal to anyone.

Well, apparently, I was wrong.

After school yesterday he and his boyfriend came up to me and said there was something really important they needed to tell me. My son said that they were dating and had been for a year. Well... I was surprised that he wasn't aware I knew and was a bit thrown off. My mouth moved faster than my brain and I said ""Well, thats pretty fucking gay.""

Now, I thought it was peak comedy, since it is infact gay. However, I understand using the word gay in that way gives it a very negative undertone, hence the mouth faster than brain comment. 

Now my son and I are usually pretty ""edgy"" with our humor, this being fairly tame for the stuff we joke about. While probably not appropriate for the situation, it wasn't our norm for a conversation between us. However, he and his boyfriend were very, very upset and left. 

I'm probably the asshole but I thought I would check, and see if yall had some advice on what I can say to fix it. He currently won't respond to my texts or calls.

Iiiiii did not expect this to gain so much traction. It's a bit intimidating, lol. I am reading all the comments, though. Anyways, here is a small update - Hes at his grandparents' house, which I knew. He told them to tell me he'll be home tomorrow after school to talk. I'll update you all after the conversation.

My sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200B;

I hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200B;

I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.

&#x200B;

Along with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

It seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200B;

I've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

I've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?

I won’t say exactly how much but it’s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It’s enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I’m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don’t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?

I’ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there’s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.

After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She’s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide “The Rules” like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who’s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

But I doubt she loves him. We’ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she’s been open with me that she doesn’t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt “pretty neutral” about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she’s ever done, and doesn’t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'

So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""How do you pronounce that?"" It's Tina!

I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, ""Just for the record, my name is Tina!"" to lighthearted, ""Tina, like Tina Belcher!"" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, ""Thanks Tiana!"" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:

Chuck: Thanks, Tiana

Tina: No problem, Chad!

Jessica: Hi Tiara!

Tina: Good morning, Jennifer!

Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.

EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:

A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.

EDIT #2:

No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or ""Tiara""

No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!

Yes, I correct them every time.

No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!","WIBTA if I started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'

So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""How do you pronounce that?"" It's Tina!

I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, ""Just for the record, my name is Tina!"" to lighthearted, ""Tina, like Tina Belcher!"" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, ""Thanks Tiana!"" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:

Chuck: Thanks, Tiana

Tina: No problem, Chad!

Jessica: Hi Tiara!

Tina: Good morning, Jennifer!

Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.

EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:

A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.

EDIT #2:

No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or ""Tiara""

No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!

Yes, I correct them every time.

It's bullshit.

My fiance and I thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. Well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised, but it was a good surprise.

Back in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200B;

Since my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again.

I'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

Five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.

​

Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said ""This is John"" and described my job.

​

Ted: ""Hi, Jack.""

Me: ""It's John.""

​
Ted: ""What?""
​

Me: ""My name's John, not Jack.""

Ted: ""It's close enough for me.""

Supervisor: ""His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.""

​

This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""

​

Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.

​

Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says ""Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

As promised, I ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

The first one was along the lines of ""Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.""

E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.

Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!"" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

Supervisor: ""Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.""

​

I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.

Supervisor: ""I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

​

A few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.

​

*AM* I the a-hole on this?","AITA For ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name?I've worked at my office for 8 years. I'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

Five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.

​

Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said ""This is John"" and described my job.

​

Ted: ""Hi, Jack.""

Me: ""It's John.""

​
Ted: ""What?""
​

Me: ""My name's John, not Jack.""

Ted: ""It's close enough for me.""

Supervisor: ""His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.""

​

This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""

​

Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.

I’m losing sleep over this.

I’m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

My brother is gay, but my family doesn’t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century’s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

So my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I’m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it’s kind of a secret, as he hasn’t told my family he is gay.

I’ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.

But he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won’t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn’t accept my brother being gay.

Anyway, that’s his decision not mine, so for now he won’t say anything.

Until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

If it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don’t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don’t want to get the attention away from my fiancée, that’s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it’s a pretty good reason

I asked him why my wedding day, he said it’s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can’t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

I didn’t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

With a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

Next day I got a text and he said “ dont worry, going alone”. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don’t seem to know what’s happening because they didn’t say anything.

He eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

This is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?

PS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

PS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!

Update: spoke to fiancée, couldn’t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

Clarification: I know it won’t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn’t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don’t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother.

I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte. 

My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

Anyway, Mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. Most leave and we’re still hanging out. I’m like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? I go change after them. And meet her bf in the hot tub she’s getting new drinks. I hop in. Immediately, he’s looking at my chest. I pretend I don’t notice and just make small talk. She comes out a few min after. And just looks in shock. Eventually gets in. “Uhh is that the one I bought?” Yeah I love it. I wear it everywhere. Make up some stuff about how I wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she’s just like “oh”. 

We’re in the tub for 20-30. Eventually get out and change. She approached me after and was like. “Uhm I’m sorry thought you’d notice. But it goes kinda see thru”. I’m like yeah I know why’d you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? “She’s like it’s a joke. Wait you knew? So you just spent last 30’ flashing my bf on purpose?” I reply I’m just wearing my birthday gift from her.

However, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

I've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.

Victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

She looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?

James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.

Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.

So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot...

So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.

So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.

So James came in and was like ""sir is there a problem here"" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like ""OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired."" 

I started acting real sad, like ""no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee"" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.

The angry guy started to backtrack, like ""It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it"" and James was like ""No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service""

Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and ""fire"" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. 

Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.

We had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off.

Ten years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. 

So here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. 

So recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her.

We had been planning to get married in November 2020 but I found out at the start of this month that she cheated on me. She begged me to give her another chance but I broke it off. 


The problem was that being cheated on is, in my mind, completely emasculating and humiliating. So I never told anyone that was the reason we broke up. For obvious reasons, Sarah also didn’t tell people we broke up because she cheated. So people have “blamed” me for the breakup, including my mom. They just see that I dumped her out of the blue. 


I’ve gone very strict no contact with Sarah after I discovered she was cheating on me. Sarah has been talking with my mom and has convinced her that if we could talk one more time, we would be able to reconcile. My mom has been applying hard core pressure on me to talk with Sarah but I’ve explained that there’s no chance we will ever get back together. 


So tonight I go over to my mom’s place because she’s hosting family for Christmas Eve. I’m there for a bit talking with my aunts and uncles and cousins when the doorbell rings and I can see it’s Sarah. I ask wtf is going on and my mom says she invited Sarah so we can work this out in the spirit of the holidays. 


I’m pissed now because the only way to explain my side of the story is to tell everyone I was cheated on. Complete humiliation in front of my whole family. So as my mom goes to the front door, I go into the bathroom. My mom starts knocking on the door saying that I need to come out and talk to my ex like an adult. I say fuck it, kick out the window screen and get in my car and go home.

Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).

By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, ""He's still pretty big"", ""Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness"", ""Maybe lose a little more around that gut"". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.

Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, ""Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?"" I flipped out. I yelled, ""Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?""She said back to me, ""Defensive much?""  
""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?"" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. ""Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!"" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, ""Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!""  
""But you're way older!"" she whined.

My son is almost 17. This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present. 

I was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it.

After talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such.

However, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he ""really liked it"" and ""it would only be fair"", the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was ""fair"" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.

I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle.

My freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time. 

Anyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's.

I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything

Then my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit.

I said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.

So I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. 

And she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.

I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. 

Her husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.

I was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.

My mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too.

AITA for giving that number?","AITA for saying my babysitting rates are $35 an hour?I'm a software engineer, with a full time job and a side hustle of doing freelance coding work in my own time.

My freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time. 

Anyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's.

I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything

Then my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit.

I said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.

So I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. 

And she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.

I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. 

Her husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.

I was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.

My mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too.

It sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos.

And I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures.

Edit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and ""no means no"" and ""this body is my own"" (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public.

I sustained very bad injuries to my face this month. I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender ""new skin"". I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline. 

In some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol.

But in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as ""the girl with the scar"" and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently.

This week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged.

I'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist. 

It also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny.

So I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding.

I wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about... 

His father said to me, ""Can you cover that injury?"" 

I said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will. 

He started snapping at me saying ""there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one.""

I said ""this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public.""

He started to backtrack saying ""just until it's healed"" and I said ""it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude. 

He actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes.

I'm a schizophrenic.  Started when I was 22, and will last till I die. I'm active in schizophrenic communities, go to groups,  the works but I am fairly private about it to most people to include friends. It's fairly common for people to think I'm eccentric (comes with the turf) due to some of my habits. Those habits include not going to parties or other places with lots of people, suddenly deciding not to do something (I have to be protective not to do or go to certain things if I think a delusion might be coming on), saying the occasional odd quip, normal schizophrenic stuff.

Some friends thought it would be funny to make it seem like  I might be going crazy as a group. They would individually wear something silly like a wizard hat or dinosaur costume (TRex blow up costume) to a group event or say something totally out of the ordinary and pretend like it was normal (Police like to track people like you, covid is just a way to microchip you, etc). These are very real scary thoughts to me. I would ask members of the group if they had heard concerns about these conspiracies or weird garb from the other members, but they all acted like they had hung out with that particular member that day and I hadn't been involved.

I was really, really scared that this could have been a massive delusion morphing into a full psychosis so I preemptively checked myself into a hospital to stop myself from potentially hurting myself or diving further into the rabbit hole(common in schizophrenic community). I was so scared my medications stopped working. No one heard from me for a few days while I was in the hospital, and when I checked out I confided in one of them about what had happened. I got a really long apology explaining what had happened and I blew up at them. 

I have ignored attempts from the others trying to apologize and have no desire to talk with them again.

AITA for not previously stating that I am schizophrenic?

Edit- People have been asking saying to post the length of the prank. Around 3 weeks.

Edit 2- Thank you for the awards and stuff, but I really want to highlight some of the messages I have gotten. I'm at around 150 messages and counting and am trying to respond to the ones where I can hopefully offer insight.

Resources that I find helpful- r/schizophrenia 

For groups just google schizophrenia support groups in my area, something will pop up and when you actually get there someone will have a further list. 

You get what you put into groups. You don't have to talk your first couple of times. But no one will look at you with the batshit look if you say ""Reality check- is there a bird in the room or something in that regard"". That did happen once and the audible sigh of relief from 8 other people and the laughter that followed was hysterical. 

Medication helps so much. It's the difference between being able to go for a walk with my dog and staying in bed all day. But it takes time. So many people have asked what drug and dosage a loved on should go on. I cannot answer that. There are so many drugs out there and different dosages. I can tell you that you (probably) will not have a noticable difference in behavior in two weeks after trying a medication. You start small, and work your way up to a therapeutic effect (when it actually helps). It might take some time to actually get to feeling human again.

I'm really close with her, so I've been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation. 

My brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. 

Since then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. He has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on Facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted SHE was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick.

I told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and I don't want to be involved with him anymore because I think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I'm being a homophobic asshole, and that I don't know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don't accept him, I'm a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point.

I’m also extremely shy and from a very conservative family so my resentment and shame towards my bust is an ongoing issue. 

My friend *Sarah is one of those unfiltered free thinkers who says whatever is on her mind. She’s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I’m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes. 

Sarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they’re a physical feature I’m uncomfortable with but doesn’t let up. Examples of things she’ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they’ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she’ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my ‘cartoon boobs’. I know she’s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I’ve told her a few times to drop it before. 

Now we’re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *‘Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you’re in a porno. We don’t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.’* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven’t spoken again. I’m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?



**Edit:** I’m fuming. I just spoke with a colleague, *John, (who was part of the video call that day) and he told me that Sarah’s been telling everyone that it’s ME that’s been bullying her and making her feel insecure about her appearance. When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I’ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don’t even understand the stupid ‘boy body’ insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she’s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn’t sure at first but fuck it, I’m reporting her. I don’t know why I ever considered her a friend, she’s fucking mental and annoying.


**Edit 2:** I now feel stupid for even asking the question AITA. I thought I may have been at one point because the video call was amongst mostly work mates rather than clients and I wasn’t sure if my sensitivity towards my body image made me overreact to a joke that could have been innocent (I now realise it wasn’t).

I’ve also spoken to another coworker who is closer to Sarah and she thinks Sarah may have  already reported me to HR. She said the phone conversation we had after the meeting was filled with abusive bullying language and physical threats. It wasn’t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don’t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming. She also suggested that I’ve convinced the guys in the office to take my side by being a flirt and a tease (did I mention that I’m stupidly shy?)

My head is swimming and I think I may be dealing with an actual psycho. I don’t know how it’s come to this ridiculous level of craziness. All I wanted to do was get on with my fucking work in peace and get through this crappy time but now I have to deal with this bullshit.


**Update:** Just to answer a few questions I’ve seen:

- I’ve contacted HR with my complaint. I have a lot of old text messages and emails with comments and memes Sarah has sent making fun of my chest size. John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I’m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with.

- My breasts alone aren’t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can’t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won’t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People’s comments don’t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down.

- Thank you to all for clothing suggestions. I will definitely look into tailoring some tops and have spent some time checking out Bravissimo which looks great.

- In hindsight, I should have confronted Sarah more sternly in the past but I guess I was trying to avoid conflict. Others have suggested I may have allowed her to gaslight me which may be true. I just want to move on at this point.


**Update 2:**

The coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack. Lucy does not want to take sides but has suggested I reconsider taking drastic action. Sarah is too unwell to talk to me herself but has asked I drop my complaint and she will drop hers, citing the whole thing as a misunderstanding and stress-induced disagreement. 

I have had panic attacks before in my life and I seriously felt like I was going to die. It’s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don’t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I’m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don’t directly work with one another but it doesn’t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn’t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops. 

I don’t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don’t ever have to interact with one another, I’m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don’t care.


**Last Update:**

I’m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I’ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don’t need this misery in my life. If she’s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends. 

If I don’t make any new updates, just assume that the right person was reprimanded and faced the consequences of their words and actions.","AITA for blowing up at my friend who constantly makes comments about my boobs?I have big boobs.

Sarah has asked to move teams so we don’t directly work with one another but it doesn’t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn’t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops. 

I don’t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don’t ever have to interact with one another, I’m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don’t care.


**Last Update:**

I’m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I’ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don’t need this misery in my life. If she’s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends.

Since my daughter has been dating this kid my wife has changed considerably and has given our daughter advice that has left me with raised brows more than once. 

Some of the advice I’ve heard my wife give is ‘oh it’s cute for boys to pay for everything, especially in your first relationship!’ Or ‘oh honey don’t worry about that, he can pay for you, if he really liked you he would’ and similar. 

I’ve tried to balance this out by telling my daughter straight away ‘two people in a partnership should be contributing equally’ and my personal favorite ‘if someone asks if they can *take you out* to dinner, it’s reasonable to expect them to pay, but if someone asks you to grab dinner with them, it’s reasonable to split the payment’. I figured that would be an easy way for a young person to understand the difference. 

However I’ve noticed my daughter becoming more and more entitled with her boyfriends money. They haven’t been anywhere obviously since we’re home but the way she talks about him ‘oh I’ll just ask him to pay for x’ etc leaves a bad taste in my mouth. She has also flippantly bragged/ mentioned that she gets him to buy gift cards for her etc by mentioning her mother’s advice, i.e. ‘if you really liked me you’d pay for x’ 

I spoke to my wife privately and told her my concerns, she insists it’s a rite of passage for girls and it’s cute that she should feel a guy is completely spoiling her.

I heard her teacher address a girl named Kelly a few times, which stuck out to me because my daughter’s class is only about 15 kids and I know them all by this point in the year. 

A couple times more and I realized she was calling my daughter Kelly. My daughter’s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee. 

So after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher’s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn’t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her. 

I sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn’t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world. 

I encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn’t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better.

She got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was “Keeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly” and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify.

So class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there’s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said “Hi, this is *Keeley’s* Dad. Her’s name not Kelly. It’s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.” 

A few hours later I had an email in my inbox “inviting” my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle. 

The long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should’ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were “similar enough” for it to “not have warranted such drastic action.”

That surprised me. I couldn’t believe a meeting was necessary, let alone that it cast blame on us. 

I can’t tell if I’m being that annoying “my kid matters most” parent that my grandmother the schoolteacher always complained about or if the teacher should just learn her damn name because that’s a basic part of her job.

I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all

UPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now

HUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

I continued to get messages from strangers telling me how awful a person I was and how they hoped I died through various means.

So I sued my ex.

It ruined them. I knew they were financially in a bad spot and they likely couldn't afford court fees but the case dragged.

They made a video about not being able to afford court costs and such and how it was going to ruin them.

After which a bunch of friends started telling me to just let it go and move on but I had sunk money into the case as well. It wasn't cheap for me either so I didn't just let it go.

Eventually the judge ruled in my favor and I received a total of nothing from my ex......

But it meant I could link to the result in the comments section of every video she tried to frame me as the bad guy because in our state, court proceedings are public record.

Suddenly her viewership dropped and she blamed me for ruining her life.

I (27F) have been married with my husband (M32) for three years and haven been dating for a little over 5. My husband has this friend (F31) ‘Mary’. They’ve known each other since they were in high school and she’s considered ‘one of the boys’, if you may. That basically means she’s always invited to all the fishing trips and stuff, which I don’t mind at all, I trust my husband. 


Well, my problems with Mary started when she first found out I’m half Romanian. It started kinda innocently, with her asking me to say certain words, teach her some insults etc which didn’t necessarily bother me, but it usually put me on the spot whenever we were out with my husband’s group of friends. It only escalated to her googling stuff about Romania and asking me ‘are you a vampire? do you bite your husband by the neck?’ to ‘are you a gypsy? I bet you’ve got some of that gypsy blood in you’ (which is just blatantly racist)


Last week, me and my husband organised a mini BBQ with our friends and Mary was invited by my husband despite me telling him she makes me uncomfortable. He said he had talked to her about her remarks and she’s been understanding so it’s unlikely she’ll say something this time.


It was midnight and there were about 4 of us left and I accidentally spilled some red wine on Mary’s jeans when I tripped over a carpet. All hell broke loose. Mary started saying that I’m a witch and I’m trying to ruin her life and this whole thing is part of my ritual and I’m just a ‘immigrant gypsy trying to ruin my husband’s life’ and I’ve poisoned my husband against her. I started crying and profusely apologising. When she wouldn’t drop it, I kicked her out and banned her from ever coming to my house again. 

AITA for doing this? My husband insists that Mary was just drunk and talking nonsense and he would talk to her. He also told me I’m way too sensitive about my heritage and I’m an a-hole for banning her. Mary has since given me a half hearted apology but I’m still not ok with her.


EDIT: I guess this is the update some of you wanted. Sorry I’m still a mess and idk how coherent I am. We’ve talked. He admitted to being in and out of an affair with Mary in the first 2y of our relationship and she wanted to win him back I guess. I called my mom to come help me pack some stuff and im out. Thats it. Mary can have him I’ve been gaslit for years and it took a reddit post to realise. Oh the irony. thank you reddit.


EDIT2 and probably the last one for a period of time: 



A lot of people seemed suspicious of Mary and my husband’s friendship/relationship etc and have asked if I ever suspected anything. No, I didn’t. Me and my husband had (or I thought we had) a very strong relationship, based on communication and honesty (guess it only applied to me). Also, Mary is very close with all the boys in the said friendship group. The other wives raised concerns in the past but they’ve all been shut down by the boys in the group or by Mary herself. I guess I always respected their friendship group because they were very close for so long and it felt unfair to change that because of me. As far as I’m aware, the other wives feel the same - plus Mary has been in a LD relationship for about 2 years and always claimed she’s focusing on her career, she’s too busy etc so none of us ever saw her as a potential threat.

So I am a 30 year old man. I'm single and live alone in a house that I own. A few months ago you know what happened and my mom lost her job. So I decided to let her stay with me.

I have a medical marijuana card and smoke every day. I knew my mom disliked weed so I warned her before she moved in that I would be smoking weed daily and would not stop for her. She agreed, and only asked that I smoke outside. Which I thought was a relatively reasonable request; weed has a strong smell and many people don't like it.

At first this worked out fine at first. But she started making remarks about how I should quit, ect. I mostly just ignored them/brushed them off. Then it evolved to her demanding that I quit. As if I were still  a child she could issue orders to. I refused and told her that she can move out if she doesn't like it. She started crying and saying that I don't love her, I have a problem, ect. 

The next day, I come home from work to find her waiting for me. She explained that she had flushed my weed (a little less than an ounce) for my own good. And then demanded that I go to treatment. 

Well, predictably, I was furious. And not even really about not having the weed anymore. It is pretty cheap (I usually buy ounces for $125) and I can easily get more. It was about her total lack of respect for me. I'm an adult, own my own house, have a good job, and have approval from the state to legally purchase and possess marijuana.  So someone I'm doing a huge favor for demanding that I stop and throwing out my stuff when I refused is extremely outrageous to me. No matter if she pushed me out of her vagina 30 years ago.

Anyway, we argued about this for a while and it became clear to me that she was not sorry at all and that she would probably do it again. So I told her she can't live with me anymore. I gave a month, but she has already packed all her shit and drove to my brothers house a couple hours away. 

She obviously thinks I'm a huge asshole. So does my brother. But I think that's mostly because she is his problem now.","AITA for throwing out my mom after she threw out my weed?Throwaway in case someone I know sees this, don't want them to know my main reddit account.

As if I were still  a child she could issue orders to. I refused and told her that she can move out if she doesn't like it. She started crying and saying that I don't love her, I have a problem, ect. 

The next day, I come home from work to find her waiting for me. She explained that she had flushed my weed (a little less than an ounce) for my own good. And then demanded that I go to treatment. 

Well, predictably, I was furious. And not even really about not having the weed anymore. It is pretty cheap (I usually buy ounces for $125) and I can easily get more. It was about her total lack of respect for me. I'm an adult, own my own house, have a good job, and have approval from the state to legally purchase and possess marijuana.  So someone I'm doing a huge favor for demanding that I stop and throwing out my stuff when I refused is extremely outrageous to me. No matter if she pushed me out of her vagina 30 years ago.

Anyway, we argued about this for a while and it became clear to me that she was not sorry at all and that she would probably do it again. So I told her she can't live with me anymore. I gave a month, but she has already packed all her shit and drove to my brothers house a couple hours away. 

She obviously thinks I'm a huge asshole. So does my brother.

She'd been stuffing toilet paper in her underwear, hoping that would work. I explained to her that periods are nothing to be ashamed of, and found some great resources online for us to review together. I took her to the store to pick out brands of feminine products she wanted to use (she picked Playtex Sport because she's a gymnast). 

After we were done, I decided I should do the same thing with my other two. My 12yo volunteered to be part of preparing them, and we made a whole night of it; it was wonderful, and I learned a lot. I even learned what a menstrual cup is, and how they benefit the environment.

The other day, my ex called back. I'll usually arrange a video chat and leave the room so they can have some alone time, and when they're done chatting, I'll come back in to talk boring co-parenting stuff like school, bills, etc. This last time, my ex was FURIOUS with me for talking about periods with the girls. She shouted at me that I was sick and perverted, why didn't I call her myself if I knew it was so urgent, I could've called one of their grandmas/aunts, but my mom has dementia, while her mom and sisters call me a loser because I teach kindergarten, so I'm not fond of them.

My ex told me I was being immature and should have just toughed it out for the girls. This really pissed me off, so I shouted back that maybe if she wasn't such a deadbeat and answered her goddamned phone once in a while, she could have handled this. I brought up everything she does that hurts them; she hasn't been to a single soccer game, piano recital, or gymnastics meet in two years, every other weekend when they come home from her house, they go straight to their rooms, only to emerge hours later asking me why she loves her new husband more than them, and what did they do to make her leave.

A minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him.

She just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short.

I thought that was all over and done with until I'd gotten an email from a woman, a month later, asking about her son's application, she seemed offended he hadn't gotten an acceptance or rejection. 

It bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own.

I sent an email back saying I was not at liberty to send information about an application to anybody but the applicant. I also asked HR to send an email to the kid saying sorry but we were not making him an offer. (It is something we usually do, but his rejection email must have slipped through the cracks with all the Covid craziness.)

Anyway, after we sent that, I got a phone call from his mom, she had a forwarded copy of the email, and she was demanding answers.

I said that I could not comment on the guy's performance in the interview to her as she was not the applicant. If he wanted to reach out to me I was happy to give him some feedback. 

However, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc.

I also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc... Would also put their resume in the ""do not hire"" pile. Since, while the applicant may be skilled and motivated, they need the ability to demonstrate those traits themselves.

Obviously, they can’t have the wedding as planned, but they still would like to get married, so they decided on a “Zoom” wedding where all of the family/friends would just call in to watch the officiant, my sister, and her fiancé. 

My sister didn’t want to be in charge of hosting the Zoom call because she thought it would stress her out, so she asked me to and I gladly accepted. 

She and her fiancé decided to invite everyone they originally wanted to, and it was a very big list. When we were going over the list, my sister mentioned to me that she wanted everyone else to be muted for the majority of the wedding as she was worried that others would talk over her and her fiancé and quote “overshadow” them on their big day “that was already scaled down”. However, her and her fiancé said that I should unmute everyone at one point so everyone could talk and have a nice time with each other. 

Fast-forward to the day of the wedding—everyone is muted during the ceremony which goes great, and so I then unmute everyone and ask to please raise a hand if they’d like to talk so it doesn’t get confusing. My cousin (around my age) starts waving his hand crazily, and he’s with his longtime girlfriend (also similar age I guess). He’s a very gregarious guy, so I was not surprised. Then, he says stuff like “(my sister) and (her husband) are such an inspiration, it’s given me the courage to do this....” then turns to his girlfriend and pulls out a box that is the size of an engagement ring box??

I immediately saw this as him trying to steal the spotlight (something that he’s done since we were kids, ex: he would secretly mess up my sister and I’s drawings if the adults would praise ours) and booted him off of the call. Then I quickly announced that my cousin had technical difficulties and would not be joining again. Everyone else accepted this and went about talking, and my sister and her husband did too. 

The rest of the wedding went smoothly—except for the fact that my cousin kept texting me angrily saying that he finally wanted to propose as a surprise with family all around and I ruined it.

Today was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary.


He starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway. 

He gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight.

Leaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else. 

I go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again. 

At 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away. 

It's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone. 

As far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work). 

He is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch.

Anyways because of the pandemic, her original venue has made her cut down on guests because they’re cutting capacity by half. As a result she’s sending out “re-invites” that asks everyone to RSVP again. But in order to figure out who to invite and who to cut, she’s asking all confirmed guests to submit two 250-word “essays” to two questions. The gist is that they’ll use these essays to choose who can come or not, based on people’s enthusiasm. People who don’t write the essays at all will be automatically disqualified.

The questions aren’t even pandemic-related, its broad topics like ”why do you still want to celebrate this day with us?” And “what will attending our wedding mean to you specifically?” So she’s blatantly looking for people to kiss ass and tell her why they REALLY want to go. 

Anyways I told her in advance I’m not writing 500 words on why I NEED to attend her wedding, spend my own money on plane tickets/hotels, and buy her a present.

I hesitated at first, considering I only have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course I invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room.

For the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. Then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. The living room is by far the biggest room I have, so I told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/TV/bookshelves.  The living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so I reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.

It's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. When they first moved in, I would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. Now whenever I go in, there's a strange vibe like I'm intruding. My brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when I go in (I always knock) and stare at me pointedly until I leave. Sometimes when I sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.

This came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. The timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.

I basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no WAY I'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. She sent me back a HUGE message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy. 

I tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when I got home neither my brother/SIL were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. Today an Amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which I told him there's 'absolutely no way' I will allow him to install. My brother says I'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway.

Then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. The living room is by far the biggest room I have, so I told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/TV/bookshelves.  The living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so I reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.

It's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. When they first moved in, I would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. Now whenever I go in, there's a strange vibe like I'm intruding. My brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when I go in (I always knock) and stare at me pointedly until I leave. Sometimes when I sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.

This came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. The timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.

I basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no WAY I'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. She sent me back a HUGE message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy. 

I tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when I got home neither my brother/SIL were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. Today an Amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which I told him there's 'absolutely no way' I will allow him to install. My brother says I'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway.

We started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going.

Some backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not.

I didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, ""Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life."" 

Everyone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said ""well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17.

I (16f) have a friend named Aysha (15f). Aysha is Muslim and wears a hijab to school which often causes people to give her dirty looks, comments, etc. I don’t know why. It’s just cloth.

Then she forcibly tried to remove her hijab. I moved her hand away and we went to the principal. Instead of getting a punishment, Megan made up a sob story about how it would harm her position on some prestigious soccer club she was in. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. She makes a TikTok that said “when you get called to the principals office for telling the Muslim girl to take off her durag”.

He said he’s been building up a lot of “resentment” the past few months that I “make” him do half the chores and childcare, since in his “culture”, women do the chores and hands-on childcare, and men do the fun parenting, the discipline, mow the grass, and bring in the cars for oil changes when needed.

Because of these financial troubles, my auns, uncles, and grandma have had over the years to lend them money, we were evicted a couple of times (that I know), we have had the water, the electricity and the internet cut... Many things that over the years I admit have affected my emotional and mental health.

All of this has made my relationship with my parents very difficult over the years, more when they would take advantage of me making me pay for many things with the money that I earned working during holidays to pay for college or making me call my grandma to ask her for money, all of it while my mum used to spend money whenever she could in purses or jewellery .

In the moment I became an adult because they started to sign on the bills under my name without my permission mostly because their credit was so bad that the companies wouldn't allow them to sign with their own names. When I figured it out I asked them to stop but they just lied about it and I just let it go because I couldn't deal with it.

Fast forward to the present, because of the 'rona situation, I was looking forward the money from my income tax return, because my salary has gone down so this money would have helped a lot. Instead of it, I received a letter from a courthouse saying that the money has been confiscated. I immediately phoned my mum and she said that she didn't know anything about it but she will fix it. Since I don't trust her at all I called the court myself and then they explained me that during the last year there has been a proccess against me by a company I owe money from unpaid bills. All the papers had been sent to my parents and they had sign and take them. The debt was not paid with the money from the tax income so part of my salary from now on will be confiscated too until is fully paid.

So my parents stole my identity to contract a bill under my name, didn't pay for it and when the company claim that debt through lawyers and a judge they kept all the papers from me (which is also illegal) apparently waiting for all of it to be fixed by itself.

My mother said that it was her right to put it under my name because I am her daughter and it is my duty to help with the family burdens. Since then, and after really nasty words from her side and my sister's (who says that I am ungrateful and selfish) I haven't spoken to them and I am in the middle of a global pandemic with my salary already low, paying for a debt that it is not mine.

My friends and boyfriend say that I should talk with the police and stop all of this because otherwise they will keep doing it and I am afraid they will.

So, WIBTA if I speak with the court even if it means that my parents (70 and 63) could go to jail?

All of this has made my relationship with my parents very difficult over the years, more when they would take advantage of me making me pay for many things with the money that I earned working during holidays to pay for college or making me call my grandma to ask her for money, all of it while my mum used to spend money whenever she could in purses or jewellery .

In the moment I became an adult because they started to sign on the bills under my name without my permission mostly because their credit was so bad that the companies wouldn't allow them to sign with their own names. When I figured it out I asked them to stop but they just lied about it and I just let it go because I couldn't deal with it.

Fast forward to the present, because of the 'rona situation, I was looking forward the money from my income tax return, because my salary has gone down so this money would have helped a lot. Instead of it, I received a letter from a courthouse saying that the money has been confiscated. I immediately phoned my mum and she said that she didn't know anything about it but she will fix it. Since I don't trust her at all I called the court myself and then they explained me that during the last year there has been a proccess against me by a company I owe money from unpaid bills. All the papers had been sent to my parents and they had sign and take them. The debt was not paid with the money from the tax income so part of my salary from now on will be confiscated too until is fully paid.

So my parents stole my identity to contract a bill under my name, didn't pay for it and when the company claim that debt through lawyers and a judge they kept all the papers from me (which is also illegal) apparently waiting for all of it to be fixed by itself.

My mother said that it was her right to put it under my name because I am her daughter and it is my duty to help with the family burdens. Since then, and after really nasty words from her side and my sister's (who says that I am ungrateful and selfish) I haven't spoken to them and I am in the middle of a global pandemic with my salary already low, paying for a debt that it is not mine.

My friends and boyfriend say that I should talk with the police and stop all of this because otherwise they will keep doing it and I am afraid they will.

So, WIBTA if I speak with the court even if it means that my parents (70 and 63) could go to jail?

A couple weeks ago he got his workplace to change it, and his coworkers found out. About half of them think this is the funniest thing ever and about half are deeply offended. Brenda is in the offended half, and has made that clear. 

He and I are in a group chat with his coworkers where we organize carpooling during the pandemic. It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring. 

Yesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that. 

Brenda messages the group saying ""maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts"" I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done. 

Me: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lol

Brenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship. I'd be embarrassed as a wife if I did so little for my husband

Me: well I work more hours and pay the bills, so I think he can oxyclean his own shirts if it's so important

Brenda: maybe you should learn to take proper care of your husband or you'll find yourself divorced. 

Me: I'll let you know when I need relationship advice from someone who is 42 and single

Now apparently Brenda is going around and saying that I ""mocked her for being single in her 40s"". I don't care if someone is single in their 40s, but I think it's absolute bullshit that she can call me a bad wife but I can't point out she has no frame of reference.

Me and my daughter, Anya, are from India. Our native language is Hindi. She 11 years old now. Her father died when she was 5 and I immigrated to states because everyone was trying to get me remarried to a 60 year old sleazebag because ""oh no. How ever will a woman live or raise a child alone"". 

I stated dating my now-husband when Anya was 6. He had a 5 year old son, Ben (50% custody). Me, Anya, Ben, Husband and Ben's mum get along really well. The kids were very well adjusted and they were genuinely happy when we got married. Whenever tensions arose, we dealt with them patiently. Let's just say after walking through the minefield of Indian family/drama, diffusing these toy bombs were very easy. 

Anya has a habit of talking in Hindi when she gets really excited. Sometimes, while talking to me, she starts talking in Hindi without even realising it. This wasn't a problem. If she does that while others are around, I would remind her and she would revert back to English. 

Few months ago, Ben's mum passed away and he came to live with us full time. He has a room already and we put Ben into therapy immediately. 

A week ago, Ben walked in when me and Anya were cooking and we were talking in Hindi and he started crying. He told me he is feeling bad that he can't understand what we are saying. I hugged him and consoled him and assured him that we didn't do it to exclude him purposefully. And then Anya started crying and apologised. The whole thing was just heartbreaking. 

Since then, Anya has been making concious efforts to talk only in English and I can tell that it puts Ben at ease. Yesterday, however, she was frustrated and started lamenting about school work in Hindi to me. Me and Anya were in the living room and Ben and husband were in the kitchen and they heard it. 

Later that night, my husband told me how he thinks we must start thinking about giving punishments whenever she speaks in Hindi unconsciously until Ben starts feeling better. 

I was horrified at this suggession. I have never pulled the ""She is my daughter, not yours"" card. But this is the hill I am willing to die on and use that card if necessary. 

Whether he likes it or not, it's her first language. Expecting her to always converse in her second language, even when she is feeling some extreme emotions is just cruel. Especially after she is genuinely making an effort to make Ben feel more comfortable. It's almost like punishing for her heritage or for her being Indian. 

Of course, this is a huge point of conflict between me and my husband. I think it's unfair to do this to Anya, even temporarily. He thinks me and Anya are unnecessarily making feel Ben bad while he is mourning his mother, while we can try and prevent it.

I’m going to be vague for privacy reasons, sorry.  

I (33F) am the breadwinner of our household. I have multiple, highly specialized degrees for a niche industry. I make 200k+, with potential to get in the 600-M’s range. My company has not been hit that badly by COVID, so most of us have kept our jobs, but we’re held to strict standards.  

My husband (36M) has a broad degree/work experience. He quit his job right before COVID hit, hoping for a better job in the meantime, and I was supportive. He spent a ton of time applying to various jobs, and finally landed an interview at Organization X. 

This is his dream job, in almost every imaginable way (I can’t be detailed). However, it’s paying about 65k a year, which would be fine except this job directly puts my job stability at risk. 

My company and this org. are adversarial, at best. My field is extremely secretive, and if clients discovered my spouse was working for a competitor, I would be permanently tainted. I wouldn’t be able to get a job in the industry forever. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I promise you, it absolutely is not.

It’d be like if I worked in protecting the privacy of celebrities, and he worked for TMZ. If he tapped my car, got into my work devices, he could use that to advance his career, and any trust I have in this field will be gone. Even if I trusted my husband not to do that, my clients and company don’t. Worse, b/c my background is so specialized, this is the only field I can work in. 

I asked him to drop from consideration for this job, since if he got it, we’d lose my income. 65k a year cannot support us in this city. Plus, he does not have to work for this organization. Even if the job market is awful right now, his background gives him access to a wide range of jobs, but I only have this one, niche field. 

He was extremely angry, and said I was “selfish and only cared about money.” I told him that if he wanted to go back to school for an advanced degree or just be unemployed for a while, I would support him, but taking this job isn’t possible. 

He continued the process behind my back, and got the offer. He wants to accept it, b/c he says his career needs to take priority and that I wasn’t being a supportive wife. 

I feel so betrayed, and I’ve contacted all relevant higher ups in my company to inform them. I notified them as soon as he got the interview, b/c it’s better coming from my email than from a background check. 

I told him he could decline the offer, w/me watching him physically decline it, or he could accept the offer and move out immediately. I would pay for him to stay two weeks at a hotel, and we would begin divorce proceedings. My company is willing to take care of all of my legal fees. 

I feel fucking awful. I still love him. I moved decisively, b/c this was the best way to cut my losses, but it still hurts. He called me heartless and cold.

I (24f) gave birth to my daughter six months ago and it should've been the happiest moment in my life. When my daughter was born her skin was very dark and looked like she could have two biological parents who were of African descendent. My husband Jim (26m), fake name, was furious and accused me of cheating and left right then and there. He told everyone on both sides of the family what happened, made posts on social media and wanted a divorce. His family and a lot of our friend all called to say how upset they were at me and called me really nasty names. My mother was by my side the entire time and I kept professing my innocence. Jim refused to pick me up from the hospital, threw my stuff out on the lawn and changed the locks, so I had to stay with my parents. When my sister called to ask for the baby stuff Jim texted me pictures of the bare nursery room and said he got rid of everything. He even destroyed my Art studio, I like to paint, and the art I made and told me my work would be too awful to sell. I was distraught and tried to focus on my baby.

Weeks went by and Jim refused to speak to me directly and has never once asked about our child. Eventually he agreed to do a paternity and he was 100% the father. No one could believe the results and it was done again, Jim's the dad. Around that same time one of Jim's cousins did the Ancestry thing and there was around 30% of African ancestry in the family. This combined with the test Jim paternal great-grandmother admitted to having an affair around the time Jim's grandfather was born and was because he could pass she just assumed her husband was the father.

Since then Jim has been reaching out and everyone has come to apologize, and while it did feel good to feel vindicated the damage has been done. I can't un-hear or unsee all the horrible things that was said and done. Not just to me but to my child as well. Jim made some very racist remarks. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. Regardless of what our daughter looks like I don't want her to be around that. What else will Jim and his family say or do the next time they get mad? How are they going to treat our daughter when she does something that upsets them?

Jim has been begging for forgiveness. I said I needed time, he asked to see the baby and I let him but I'm too afraid to physically hand her to him. He's repairing the the nursery and keeps asking me what I would like and I cry every time saying we already had what I liked and some of the items that we had can't be replaced. He asked me if I still loved him and I admitted that he showed me his worst self and I don't know if I could live with that image. I didn't mean to be hurtful but it's how I feel. My sister suggested Couple's Therapy but I don't feel like I should have to work to fix something that I didn't break. I've never cheated and have been 100% innocent in all of this the whole. AITA for not wanting to give Jim a second chance?

Update 1: I stepped away for a few hours and couldn't believe what I came back to. I am truly amazed by all the wonderful comments of support as well as the private messages. I also understand why some people may think this is fake and all I can say is that you are free to believe what you want in this. I also see some questions and I think I should clarify a few things just in case your judgement may change.

1. All of this initially happened at the near February and I was already settled at my parents' house before the pandemic hit.
2. One of the reasons Jim wouldn't pick me up from the hospital was because I wouldn't admit to cheating or give him any details, because there weren't any which made him angrier.
3. Based on the pictures Jim sent me he didn't take a sledgehammer to the crib or anything. He just took stuff down to either return it for the money or gave it away. While deeply hurtful I wouldn't call it violent, but maybe it is.
4. Online he announced that I ""pushed out a dark skinned baby"" and was going to he was divorce me. His family started with the racial comments and eventually he started doing it too but only through my family, he refused to speak to me directly.
5. Once the truth came out everything he and his family posts were all taken down but I, and a few friends, still have the screenshots. Jim never wrote down his racial remarks.
6. While he didn't say any of the racist words he did make comments about our daughter being a ""Welfare Princess,"" and how I was going to be just another ""baby mama.""
7. Just to clarify. Jim is ""white"" and I am at least half white. One of my parents is adopted and with everything that's happened they decided to do the Ancestry thing too and we should be getting the results any day now.

Thank you so for all your words of encouragement a couple months back, both in posts and the DMs. A lot of things have happened since my initial post and I just needed time to process it and be in a place where I can write about on social media. So here it goes....

First, my parent who was adopted did the Ancestry/23 thing and it turns out that Jim wasn't the only one who had African ancestry. My parent had at least 45%, which means I have at least 20%. I am legally separated from my husband with primary custody, and I'm living with my parents until further notice. He still keeps apologizing and wants me to come back to the house, he even offered to leave so I could stay with our daughter but I don't want to and really like having the support of my parents. My dad is retired so he does a lot of the babysitting while my mother and I work remotely.

I do go to the house every so often so Jim can see his daughter and for Couple's Counseling via telecom. In one of the sessions Jim confessed something really hurtful and some of you guessed right, he cheated. It was while we were dating, before he proposed, and his treatment towards me was a projection. It was with an ex-girlfriend who had cheated on him and he hooked up with her as an ego boost. He started to feel guilty but was too scared that I would walk away to ever confess. Jim also admitted that he was scared when I got pregnant (our baby wasn't planned), was very anxious about being a father, but just pretended to be excited because he didn't want to look like an A. My husband was so willing to believe that our daughter wasn't his because he thought he had an out. Now that he knows that our child is his and has spent time with her Jim regrets everything and just wants his family back and is willing to spend the rest of his life making it up to us.

This was all deeply hurtful and I've cried about it more than once. Jim has been lying to me and my ability to trust him hasn't improved at all. When the holidays came around Jim's parents asked about seeing their grandchild and I didn't want to. They told me that it was selfish of me to keep her away and I reminded them of their past. They said that they've already apologized and tried to minimize the situation. They said that I can't be angry forever and that I need to learn to forgive them. I'm so ashamed of ever loving and marrying into this family and wonder why I didn't see this before. I've decided to contact a lawyer and will be filing for divorce after my daughter's first Birthday.","AITA For Not Forgiving My Husband (26m) For A Mistake And Not Trusting Him With Our Child?Throwaway account

He’s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it’ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of “auditioning” to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she’s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she’s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn’t. 



I was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there’s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons.

He said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn’t bought her a single gift since they’ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift. 


He confronted her and said he thinks she’s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. He’s upset about the “gold digging bitch” and when I laughed he called me an asshole. He said I would never understand what’s it’s like being a rich man and being used and I get that concern, but I told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he’s delusional as hell. If he doesn’t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone if he’s not going to be genuine in his relationships unless they pass his “test”.","Aita for telling my brother he got exactly what he deserved when he pushed his girlfriend away for being a “gold digger”?My brother is a very hardworking man and at 27 he is now very wealthy and doing well for himself. He’s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it’ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of “auditioning” to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she’s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she’s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn’t. 



I was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there’s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons.

This has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.

I M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.

Despite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.

I started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.

He never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. 

Last week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this ""opportunity"" away to someone else.

I didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this.

It's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this.","Aita: For giving my deceased son's college fund to his best friend instead of my nephew?

Yesterday my sisters family came to visit. My son asked me if they could go play video games. I said yes and reminded them to be careful. About 30 minutes later my son comes running to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he led me to the front hall. When we get to the stairs I see the new system smashed on the floor. Someone had thrown it from the upstairs and it was now smashed to pieces.

I asked my son what happened and he sobbed and pointed at his cousin. I asked my nephew if he did this and he started to laugh. He said that it was a “stupid baby toy” and that he saw people break them online. 

My sister came in and I told her what happened. I explained that this was an expensive system and that her son needs to be disaplined for what he did. I told her I wanted her to pay for what her son broke.

She laughed and said no. She says I shouldn’t have let them play unsupervised. That it was my fault and that I am a bad parent. She said my son will get over it and that it was not important. 

Seeing my son sitting on the ground next to his broken system trying to put the pieces back together tore my heart out. I walked over to the Christmas tree and grabbed the system that was meant for my nephew. I pulled the gift wrap off and it gave it to son and told him to go upstairs and set it up.

My sister asked me why I was making such a big deal when I had another one already. I than laughed and told her that was her sons Christmas gift. That since it wasn’t important and it was just a stupid baby toy than they obviously won’t miss it. I than told them to leave.

My nephew realized what happened and began to cry that my son had stole his system. I said no his was the one that he smashed. My sister was livid and told me that I will never see them again. I just said okay and slammed the door.

My daughter is in kindergarten and she, more accurately me, was supposed to do a family tree project for school.

So, I did it.

Some of them, like her father and my son, I have actual information for aside from that they're dead. But for most of my family and her paternal family, I literally only have birth date, death date, when they would have had their kids, and cemetery information, unless they were cremated.

The next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again. 

I told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them. 

So I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement.

My brother and I are both late 30s. We get along fine most of the time, but my brother doesn’t do well in a lot of social situations. He says things that are inappropriate, gets overly opinionated, yells a lot etc.  He just doesn’t seem to understand tact or when to let things go in a casual conversation. 

Our wives are best friends. They talk almost everyday on FaceTime. 

My wife is an ex model/actress (local) and very good with makeup.  She’s in her mid 30’s, we have 3 kids and she doesn’t wear much makeup anymore - but she got some as a gift for Christmas and decided she wanted to get more. Apparently she’s been buying cheap stuff and she wanted to splurge on some good shit. 

Anyway, she’s been testing it all out over the last month, buying more here and there and doing these crazy eyeshadow things - honestly I don’t know what I’m talking about. She looks great all the time. She’s gorgeous without makeup. She’s really talented with it though and she’s having a lot of fun. I tease her a little since she works from home and she’s wearing pajamas but her makeup looks like she’s at a nightclub. I think it’s cute and funny. 

My brother thinks she’s doing it because she’s cheating or she wants to cheat. He called me this morning to say he’s concerned because he’s seen her on FaceTime and he’s decided she must be posting pictures or sending pics to some dude or multiple dudes. I tried to blow it off and explain that it wasn’t that way, but he got more aggressive about it so I ended up yelling at him and shouting the insecure testicle man baby thing.

I want to add too (my mom and brother both asked, maybe other people will):  No, I haven’t asked my wife why she’s recently starting wearing more makeup and I’m not going to because I think asking is fucking rude. 

She’s spending her money on stuff for her face and it’s a creative hobby. I’m not going to be the dick that ruins someone’s creative outlet by asking them to justify it or by insinuating there’s a sinister motive behind it.

He was the one to reach out to give me a heads up after she expressed an interest in wanting us to connect. He and I spoke at length because I was feeling some pretty strong emotions like rage for never being told about her. 

My ex had backed out of the abortion but didn’t want me involved because we were broken up so decided just not to tell me. But he told me that Kara doesn’t know about that. Apparently I wasn’t ready for fatherhood because we were both young so I bailed. 

I couldn’t believe it. Rob (her uncle) told me he knows his sister was wrong for that but promised Kara doesn’t have any negative feelings towards me and my ex never painted me as some villain, just a young guy who knew he couldn’t properly care for her. 

He asked me not to tell Kara this when we talk if she asks and because it could hurt the way she saw her mom. I never actually confirmed I would.

Kara messaged me and we’ve been talking. I’ve met her twice and it’s been crazy emotional. Looking at this girl who looks just like me and hurting that we’re just barely getting to know each other

So far our conversations have only been about what her life was like, how my life is, what her wants/future goals are, and getting to know each other.

We met again Tuesday and she finally decided to ask the obvious questions about what made me not be involved. How did I feel, what went through my mind, did I ever think about her,etc.

I had been thinking about what to do but in that moment I just didn’t have it in me to lie so I was honest. That I was told about the abortion, had no idea she even existed until now, but that I still really want to be in her life and have the chance to be her father if she wants that. Kara was a bit emotional, we talked some more, and said she still wants me involved.

That night my messages were blowing up. Not just from rob but her grandparents as well. They’re all outraged for telling Kara about her mom because she yelled at all of them and is refusing to even take their calls. 

Yes, the lie was terrible but I just ruined the image she had of her late mother for my own benefit. Rob called me a selfish dick for not taking into consideration how this would affect Kara finding out about this.

She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far ""exotic"" trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool.

Cathy then jokes about how all this ""no travel business"" is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was ""at a native speaker level"" and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there.

I was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy ""oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk!"" (""oh fun, we have something in common then!"")

She immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she ""couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it."" Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time.

She got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added ""which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead!"" I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said ""whatever"" and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied.

However, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting ""superior"" about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a ""little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues"" behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace? AITA?

Edit1: I'm not sure about escalating this to HR, which a lot of people have told me I have to do. I feel like this might make me look immature to the rest of my colleagues (of which I am the youngest) and it might not need to go that far... It depends on if Cathy is willing to put this behind her and be professional. If all else fails I do have ""witnesses"" who would be honest about what happened, so I think I might be in the clear if she tries to twist the story. 

Edit2: Some people have taken offense to me giving the Bahamas as an example of an ""exotic"" place and are trying to make this into a race issue. I didn't know ""exotic"" was an offensive term in the US. Do I think of The Netherlands, Belgium, England, Norway, which were countries she was describing as being faraway exotic destinations, as my idea of an exotic trip? No. Not because there's a lot of white people there, but because when I think of exotic I think of a place with nice sunny weather, white sand beaches and a blue ocean. Maybe it's because I'm from Belgium, but I don't really feel like being in my home country where it's dark and rainy all the time is quite that experience. 

Edit3: Some people think she might not have understood me because she is fluent in Dutch, but learned it in the Netherlands, which has different accents. While it is true that The Netherlands and Flandres have different accents, I didn't speak a very specific dialect like West-Flemish or something. I spoke the general Dutch you'd see in the news in Flandres. I didn't speak quickly to try and make it incomprehensible to set her up. I genuinely believed she spoke Dutch because that's what she was saying, so I talked to her in normal, conversational Dutch. The same kind of Dutch I'd use in a work environment back in my home country, the same kind of Dutch I use with friends from The Netherlands. (But with a soft ""g"" lol.)

It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy ""oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk!"" (""oh fun, we have something in common then!"")

She immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she ""couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it."" Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time.

She got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added ""which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead!"" I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said ""whatever"" and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied.

However, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting ""superior"" about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a ""little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues"" behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace? AITA?

Edit1: I'm not sure about escalating this to HR, which a lot of people have told me I have to do. I feel like this might make me look immature to the rest of my colleagues (of which I am the youngest) and it might not need to go that far... It depends on if Cathy is willing to put this behind her and be professional. If all else fails I do have ""witnesses"" who would be honest about what happened, so I think I might be in the clear if she tries to twist the story. 

Edit2: Some people have taken offense to me giving the Bahamas as an example of an ""exotic"" place and are trying to make this into a race issue. I didn't know ""exotic"" was an offensive term in the US. Do I think of The Netherlands, Belgium, England, Norway, which were countries she was describing as being faraway exotic destinations, as my idea of an exotic trip? No. Not because there's a lot of white people there, but because when I think of exotic I think of a place with nice sunny weather, white sand beaches and a blue ocean. Maybe it's because I'm from Belgium, but I don't really feel like being in my home country where it's dark and rainy all the time is quite that experience. 

Edit3: Some people think she might not have understood me because she is fluent in Dutch, but learned it in the Netherlands, which has different accents. While it is true that The Netherlands and Flandres have different accents, I didn't speak a very specific dialect like West-Flemish or something. I spoke the general Dutch you'd see in the news in Flandres. I didn't speak quickly to try and make it incomprehensible to set her up. I genuinely believed she spoke Dutch because that's what she was saying, so I talked to her in normal, conversational Dutch. The same kind of Dutch I'd use in a work environment back in my home country, the same kind of Dutch I use with friends from The Netherlands. (But with a soft ""g"" lol.)

She’s been claiming that the cats wake her up constantly and that she’s frustrated every night that she “has to get up and open the door for the cats” or “the cats keep making noises” or “the cats keep jumping on her.” It got to the point where she started saying she wants me to get rid of them. I told her I’ve never seen or heard any of this, but she claims I sleep through it all.

She kept telling me she was getting less and less sleep and kept acting aggressive, blaming lack of sleep from the cats, and that if I didn’t get rid of them, she’d leave me. I legitimately started considering giving the cats to my sister, until I noticed something.

One morning she claimed she had gotten up multiple times throughout the night to help the cats. She listed a bunch of times. I thought it was weird, because I had been up until 4am, and she claimed that she “got up at 1am to open the door for them, and a few times around 3am because they were meowing and jumping on her.” I was in the bedroom the entire time while she slept, and I know none of that happened. Things weren’t adding up, so I decided to run a test.

I waited until she said she was going to bed, then I let the cats out of our bedroom, lowered my phone brightness, and faked going to sleep. I just laid there in bed for the entire night, bored, but I definately did not fall asleep. I made sure to make timestamps every 30 minutes on my phone through Discord just to be sure. I marked down every noise my cats made. One cat had jumped down from something and made a little sound at 3:18am, and one ate food relatively quietly by the bedroom door at 4:57am. Other than that, nothing happened.

Sure enough, my wife slept from 11pm until 9am, and that morning she claimed she had woken up “at least 7 times” to open doors and from cat noises and cats jumping on her. At this point I was pissed because she was clearly lying to me. I was exhausted and fed up with the lies, so I just bluntly called her out on it.

I told her, “That’s funny. I stayed up all night to monitor the cats, and they weren’t even in the room at all last night. I have timestamps and everything. So you’ve been ***lying*** to me and trying to convince me to get rid of my cats? Why?” She just sat there quitly shaking and looking pissed, then got up and left without answering. She came back hours later and ignored me whenever I talked, and when I asked her how **I’m** the bad-guy in this situation, **she finally said that I was treating her like a child by lying about sleeping and staying up all night just to see if she was lying or not** and that making timestamps and everything as if I was an investigator was “going too far” and makes me an obsessive asshole.

I did it because she was threatening to make me get rid of my cats or she’d leave me, and her claims didn’t add up.

So, am I an “obsessive asshole?”


**UPDATE:**

My wife has been Baker Acted. She did not hurt herself, just said something concerning in public.

I got a call from the hospital this morning, asking me to head over for some “family therapy.” Apparently she finally wanted to talk.

I’ll be honest, I’m pretty pissed at the reason why she’s been so hateful towards my cats. It’s absolutely asinine.

It’s nothing that anyone had suggested. *She’s not cheating. She’s not sick physically or mentally. She’s not bored of the relationship and looking for an “out.”*

According to her, ***one of the cats stepped on her laptop and ruined a story she was writing.*** She’s hated both cats ever since. I mean that sucks, but it’s not worth trying to emotionally blackmail me into getting rid of them.

I asked her why she didn’t just tell me the truth and why she’d been lying and refused to talk about it when I’d asked. Her answer was “Because you wouldn’t have gotten rid of them otherwise.” and explained that when she saw I wasn’t willing to abandon them for her, she took offense and made it a “goal” to have me pick her over them.

Sickening. Don’t know why she actually admitted to it all.

The woman with us asked me how I felt about all of it, and I just told the truth. I told her it was a nice run, but I’m ***probably*** going to want a divorce. I was asked why, and I told them. I’ve seen a new hateful, malicious side of her that I want nothing to do with. She was so set on getting rid of the cats over a *fanfiction* being ruined that she manipulated her husband.

My wife started shouting at me that I’ve betrayed her and that I’m “scum” for choosing animals over her. At least cats don’t give ultimatums like she gave.

It sucks that she’s been Baker Acted and all I guess, but it’s for the best right now. She’ll have time to process it all in a safe environment and hopefully come to terms with it. Bad husband, I know.

I’m almost sure I’m going for divorce. I’m very worried about having her in the same house as my cats. I want my cats safe. I don’t want to worry about them being harmed or “disappearing.” Screw that.

I guess I’ll do what almost all of you suggested: “Keep the cats, rehome the wife.” Not how I *wanted* it to end, but life isn’t always nice.

**If I may, I want to clear up some things from the original post:**

***I did not stare at her all night.*** We have a mute TV with subtitles playing every night. I subtly watched TV while paying attention to the cat sounds.

***I’m not allowed to install cat doors, and she won’t let me keep the doors open.*** Apartment rules.

***Why did I instantly assume she was lying?*** I’m unfamiliar with mental health/diseases. I know about some diseases, but ones that make you think your dreams happened? Tumors that make you see/hear/remember nonexistent things? Sorry that I wasn’t aware of those possibilities. So when someone tells me events happened when they literally didn’t, I generally assume they’re lying. Shame on me.

I told him that it wasn't that big of a deal and he told me that I was being petty. I called his kid a little Birch which pissed him off and honestly might of been petty.

For context: I've been married to my wife for ~10 years and we're a mixed-race couple (I'm Asian and she's Caucasian). I've gotten along with her family (MIL, BIL, SIL), but I always felt like her FIL and other SIL (Sarah) never liked me.

I'm a professionally trained chef with 15+ years of experience and I work at a high-end Chinese restaurant (a spin-off of a popular one in Beijing) in a large US city. My crew and I have won several awards, and I've been explicitly told I'll be the next executive chef. Sarah is also a professionally trained chef and works at a popular upscale French restaurant in the city. She constantly brags about it and (no joke) compares herself out loud to Ramsay and Bourdain.

Whenever I'm at my MIL and FIL's house and helping out in the kitchen, Sarah is *always* criticizing everything I do. Whether it's chopping, braising, marinating, etc., she always butts in with comments like ""Umm, I think you should actually do X like this..."". I've been patient for my wife and side stepping those comments, saying things like ""Thanks, but I think I'll stick to the way I do it.""

Things came to a head two weeks ago when my wife, FIL, MIL, and I were in her parent's kitchen prepping dinner for my MIL's birthday. We were running a bit behind so things were heated (which I kind of like because it reminded me of work) and that's when Sarah walked in. She took one look at what I was doing, scoffed, and said something like ""Oh wow, okay, so that's not the right way of doing things"". It hit a nerve and I pretty sternly told her to stop criticizing my cooking and that I'm also a chef like her. She laughed and said ""making Kung Pao chicken at some Chinese restaurant doesn't count"". The kitchen went silent, FIL snorted/chuckled, and my MIL yelled ""SARAH WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU"". I stopped what I was doing, swore at her and called her ""a racist piece of shit"", apologized to my MIL for not being able to stay, and left for home with my wife.

Apparently this caused a massive fight after we left, with my MIL/BIL/other SIL taking my side and my FIL/Sarah saying ""it was a joke but kind of true"" and that I was ""being too sensitive"". The extended family somehow got wind of this and now everyone is arguing and taking sides, with my wife even getting texts from some her cousins apologizing for Sarah's behavior. Despite being on my side, my wife is begging me to apologize so that the fighting will stop but I refuse to because fuck Sarah and her blatant racism.

AITA?

**TL;DR:** I'm a chef working at upscale Chinese resto, my SIL is a chef at upscale French resto. She's critical of my cooking skills and has now called it ""making Kung Pao chicken at a Chinese restaurant"". Family at war, wife begging me to apologize, what do?

**EDIT:** My wife has also informed me that now Sarah may be in trouble at work and she's blaming me for it. Apparently one of her co-workers heard her rant about what happened and reported it to management. (Edit: To clarify Sarah is blaming me, though my wife is partly blaming me)

**EDIT2/UPDATE:** So it looks like one of my wife's cousins found this post and put it on Sarah's Facebook wall going ""This is you right?..."". Her FB friends are starting to comment with things like ""If this is you Sarah then I'm disappointed"". I think Sarah's still at work - shit might be hitting the fan soon and now my wife is pissed too. Will try to update but might have to delete post if things go nuclear

**EDIT3/UPDATE2:** Was considering removing but I just got a voicemail from my FIL that ""[my] presence was only being tolerated up until this point"" and threatened a ""world of hurt"" if I didn't delete this post. Officially going to keep this post up and if you're still reading this Doug - I'm very disappointed in you, you're better than this. Will also continue to update and thanks again for all your support folks

**EDIT4/UPDATE3:**  *Lots of stuff just went down*

1. My wife got a call from SIL. (From wife's paraphrasing) Sarah started screaming/crying at her the moment my wife picked up and said that she just got demoted because of ""[her] {Asian slur} husband"". Apparently some of her co-workers have her on FB and showed the post to management, which combined with her earlier rant, double whammied her back to being a line cook and now she might get fired. My wife told her to go fuck herself and is now solidly on my side after taking the verbal abuse from Sarah and reading some of the comments here. My wife is still the opposite of happy though...
2. Wife called MIL and asked her WTF was going on with FIL. MIL was confused so my wife played back the voicemail I had on my phone and apparently my MIL literally just walked away from the phone without hanging up and started screaming at FIL.
3. Facebook post has now devolved into a clusterfuck flame war with family and friends jumping in.

Suffice to say, it has officialy gone nuclear

I think I'm going to have to call this a day, will make an update post when the dust settles. Thanks again folks

Turns out I'm not allowed to post an update post for some reason:
> No, you provided all your updates in the original post with your many, many edits. You can edit this in, but we will not be allowing a standalone update on this.

*I'd like to clarify that I got my wife and MIL's permissions to post this update (out respect for them and their privacy)*

Suffice to say, it's been kind of nuts this past week. My wife and I had to turn off social media for a bit because of the shitstorm caused by her cousin putting my last post on Sarah's Facebook page. Some people even tried to call the restaurant I work at to get me fired as retribution, but luckily everyone there is 100% on my side (or as my boss put it ""Fuck [Sarah], fuck those racists, fuck them so goddamn much""). I guess it didn't help them that half the calls involved threats, screaming, and more racial slurs.

We didn't hear any updates from her family, even though we assumed the shit met fan after MIL found out about FIL's threatening voicemail (*still disappointed in you Doug*). But that changed on Sunday night, when MIL suddenly showed up at our door with overnight bags. After we took a moment to help unpack and calm down, she spilled the beans on everything.


**FIL (aka Doug)**

Apparently my MIL and FIL were already having trouble in their marriage, and it was only made worse with a certain 2016 Presidential election (she's a Dem, and he had apparently gone more far-right since then). Seems that a line was crossed with the ""Kung Pao Incident"" and his voicemail. When he refused to apologize for anything (typical Doug), she asked for a divorce and he went beserk. She didn't feel safe there so that's when she came over (other BIL and SIL live out of town).


**Extended Family (aka The Great FB War of 2021)**

You may have been able to tell already, but the extended family was largely arguing/fighting/divided along political lines for a few years now and my cousin's FB post was likely just the light to set off the powder keg. According to my MIL, the fallout has allegedly already led to some break-ups, excommunication of some family members, and even an argument that ended with police involvement. Haven't verified this myself though.


**Sarah / SIL**

According to my MIL, Sarah came over to her place on Friday. The writing was on the wall and she was basically forced to quit. Despite her trying to start from scratch as a line cook, the entire staff turned against her. Nothing was coming back from the (dish) pit for her and she was getting the cold shoulder. She’s a great chef (I will admit this is true), but they took no chances since it turns out (shit you not)... they're partly owned by a Chinese investment company. Found this hard to believe and didn't want to add this detail, but it turned out to be true after some research (won't say any further for privacy). Word also got around in the local industry, and Sarah is essentially blacklisted from high-end establishments. She's now considering selling her home and moving to find work. As much as I don't like her and found her behavior horrifying, I didn't intend for this to happen so I've reached out to some buds in other states to see if they had any openings. Whether or not she wants to take itis up to her (and no, she has not apologized for anything either - but I still want to be a decent person to her).


It sure as hell doesn't feel like a happy ending. Perhaps bittersweet justice, but that's all I can give you. Thank you all for your support and for reading.

He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.
His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.

Olivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed. 

Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.
I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!

Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.
Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said ""my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff"" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this ""defect"" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.
He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.

I told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from ""spending time"" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.

She got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.

Everyone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.","AITA for telling my wife the lock on my daughter's door does not get removed til my brother inlaw and his daughters are out of our house?My brother in-law (Sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.
His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.

Olivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed. 

Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.
I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!

Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.
Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said ""my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff"" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this ""defect"" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.
He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.

Backstory: I (F28) have a friend (F28) who purchased a house late last year. It's an awesome 2 story town house and I've been over there plenty of times to help out with moving/decorating and for hanging out. As mentioned in the title, her parents purchased the house for her and her partner.

I told him I was moving, and he asked whether I bought or rented. I told him bought, because it was just easier and less awkward than telling him I inherited the house. He told me that was cool and began talking about the toasters again when my friend cut in that I had inherited my house, not purchased it. The employee went quiet and I gave her a ""what was that"" face. I was taken aback, she continued on saying ""Yeah, *I* purchased my house"". I asked ""does it really matter? I'm here to buy some kitchen appliances not tell this guy my personal issues."" She grinned and said ""it's just for the record"" which made me more confused and annoyed. (You can probably see where this is going) I replied ""Oh okay then if it's just for the record your parents purchased your house for you."" The employee quickly retreated and she walked outside of the shop. I caught up with her and she said I was a massive asshole for pointing out she couldn't afford to own without her parents help. I returned with a very similar ""my parents also helped me with getting a house too, just in a really terrible way.""

My biological (12yo) daughter ~ Susan likes to collect and read old children's books. She's become incredible reader. She had problems with reading and learning before and we were advised to encourage her to read and eversince she started reading (which she does regularly) her skills improved. she also reads to her 2yo sister everynight.

I have a (16yo), stepson ~ Levi who can be a hothead sometimes. We don't have a son~dad relationship but I respect him and he respects me though he can act quite mean and selfish towards me and his sisters. He'd throw away stuff that belongs to us over small arguments and teases Susan for spending a lot of time to read calling her grandma.

My wife and I discussed his behavior and had conversations and agreed on punishments but Levi'd go to his dad's place whenever he causes troubles then have his dad yell at me for wanting to discuss a suitable punishment. Then Levi comes home days later expecting me to let go of what he did everytime, it's frustrating.

I got a call at work from Susan saying Levi took her entire book collection and threw them in the pool after she refused to lend him and his friends her camera for his trip. My wife helped get them out but they were wet and some were torn. It was horrific because some of those books are hard to get and meant a lot to Susan as a part of her life.
I was so mad at Levi I came home to have a conversation with my wife to decide on a punishment but he already packed a small bag and went to his dad's, I asked my wife how could she let him basically run after doing this and she said he called his dad and he came to pick him up after Susan said that I was coming home to deal with the problem.

I went to his dad's house and he refused to let me see him. I told him how Levi was hiding from consequences and his dad tried to justify why Levi was acting out by blaming me for how me and Susan treat him. He even said he'd get CPS involved if I ever try to punish him because I'm not his dad, I have no right. Adding what Levi did was a reaction to my daughter being mean to him. He told me to leave because Levi won't come home til I promise not to do anything about what he did and put it in writing.

I told him Levi should stay there with him then. He's not to come back til ~he~ get proper punishment.
His dad argued it's his mom's house too and called my wife and she asked to let this go and we'll figure out some way to resolve it but I don't think it's fair for Susan to have her books ruined and Levi getting away with it. They're asking me to let it go but this will only encourage Levi to do worse if I don't deal with it now.

Then I got talked out of punishing him everytime he did something unacceptable wether to me or his sisters.

We decided to get back together shortly after my 23rd birthday. However the relationship wasn’t the same. He was somewhat withdrawn from me and I thought it was because he still blamed me. I was sick overthinking and worrying. It got to the point where i was going backwards in my process so i decided to snoop through his phone. I found out during the year we separated he had been confiding in my sister (27) and it turned to something intimate. He cut it off when we got back together but the damage was done.

Me and my sister (37f)are  not as close as we used to be because of some messed up stuff that happened years ago. I had my son Jesse (9) pretty young. Months after that to my surprise my ex was pregnant again. Only I knew it wasn’t me because having an infant to take care of and provide for left me with zero interest in sex. And we found out it was my sister’s fiancé -ex now -that she was seeing behind our backs. It hurt. Worst pain ever but for my son’s sake I tried to get past it. I come from a family of half sibs too so I wanted my son to be close to his half brother (Keith). 

Surprise, not only were they (my ex and my sister’s ex) horrible lying cheaters, but also terrible parents. Both got hooked on drugs, only escalated from there. He got locked up when Keith was 3. This particular issue with my sister happened a couple years ago: 
My ex got sick, she was scared of Keith ending up in foster care like her and I didn’t want that for him either. I legally adopted him before she passed when he was 6. Not everyone in my family was on board at first but he’s the kind of kid that is hard *not* to love so they warmed up to him. My sister never did. She hated that I brought the son of her ex fiancé into my family. And I understood why it was painful but Keith’s and Jesse’s best interest were my main priority. That’s how we drifted apart. Last weekend was my birthday and had a small barbecue at my place. My parents have tried hard to mend things between us so they convinced me to let her come too so we can chat. I thought that meant she was cool with Keith because obviously the 3 of us are a package deal. 

I asked my parents how would she feel about Keith, they said not to worry about it. Again I took it as she came around. Only she wasn’t told he would also be present. But how could he not be? He lives there. My sister got there and she was mad when she saw him . She very specifically said “I thought this was family only what’s he doing here.” Loud enough where he could’ve easily heard but thankfully he was playing with his brother. 

My sister was pissed because my parents told her Keith wouldn’t be around. And I got pissed when she told me she didn’t want him here expecting me to do something about it. So I just told her to leave, and she’s not welcome here then. There was some back and forth from her and my parents. I didn’t want that kind of talk around my sons so still made her leave. My mom seems to think I was a huge asshole for kicking her out of my party instead of trying to work things out.

AITA?","AITA for kicking my sister out of my family gathering after comment about adopted son?Some feel I (32M) should’ve handled the situation but I don’t see how I’m wrong. Me and my sister (37f)are  not as close as we used to be because of some messed up stuff that happened years ago. I had my son Jesse (9) pretty young. Months after that to my surprise my ex was pregnant again. Only I knew it wasn’t me because having an infant to take care of and provide for left me with zero interest in sex. And we found out it was my sister’s fiancé -ex now -that she was seeing behind our backs. It hurt. Worst pain ever but for my son’s sake I tried to get past it. I come from a family of half sibs too so I wanted my son to be close to his half brother (Keith). 

Surprise, not only were they (my ex and my sister’s ex) horrible lying cheaters, but also terrible parents. Both got hooked on drugs, only escalated from there. He got locked up when Keith was 3. This particular issue with my sister happened a couple years ago: 
My ex got sick, she was scared of Keith ending up in foster care like her and I didn’t want that for him either. I legally adopted him before she passed when he was 6. Not everyone in my family was on board at first but he’s the kind of kid that is hard *not* to love so they warmed up to him. My sister never did. She hated that I brought the son of her ex fiancé into my family. And I understood why it was painful but Keith’s and Jesse’s best interest were my main priority. That’s how we drifted apart. Last weekend was my birthday and had a small barbecue at my place. My parents have tried hard to mend things between us so they convinced me to let her come too so we can chat. I thought that meant she was cool with Keith because obviously the 3 of us are a package deal. 

I asked my parents how would she feel about Keith, they said not to worry about it. Again I took it as she came around. Only she wasn’t told he would also be present. But how could he not be? He lives there. My sister got there and she was mad when she saw him . She very specifically said “I thought this was family only what’s he doing here.” Loud enough where he could’ve easily heard but thankfully he was playing with his brother. 

My sister was pissed because my parents told her Keith wouldn’t be around. And I got pissed when she told me she didn’t want him here expecting me to do something about it. So I just told her to leave, and she’s not welcome here then. There was some back and forth from her and my parents. I didn’t want that kind of talk around my sons so still made her leave. My mom seems to think I was a huge asshole for kicking her out of my party instead of trying to work things out.

My little brother and I are really close. He says I'm the best friend he has and he loves me more than anyone (of course this is not true, he has many friends of his own).

My brother has been asking our step-dad/mother if he could get a new car for his grad party since last year, and he said he'd pay 50-75% with his own hard-earned money while they paid the rest. They said no. I have a car but I had been working for one, they helped me pay off for it. So my brother's arguments with our parents got heated after awhile (one time I told my brother that I'd help him pay off expenses for a good car once I got my own. He hugged me and said I didn't need to worry and that he owed me way more than I owed him). But he continued to press our parents all of last year until they gave in and said yes like they did for me.

Note that our step-dad and my brother have a negative relationship for the most part. Our bio mother and step-dad got together soon after our bio dad and mom divorced when we were little. My brother thinks that step-dad and mother were seeing each other before our real parents divorced and tbh, I think that might be true. Not certain, though.

Anyway, my step-dad, mother and brother compromised and said they'd get him the car in 2021 so that people don't gawk at him at the graduation party. June this year my brother and step-dad/mother are still on about the car, now the arguments getting loud and lasting hours until evening. My step-dad was getting into screaming matches with my brother over it but they reached a final compromise of the car being bought last week. 

The fated morning comes and my brother wakes up to our step-dad and mom guiding him outside to... a car. But not his, our mother's. Step-dad used his and my brother's money on a dumb prank, bought a completely different model of car, and said it was for our mother. Our mom and step dad just laughed and kissed each other. My brother didn't lose it, he didn't even look angry.

They asked me what was that about and I, feeling terrible for my brother, said they had it coming and not to be surprised. So now they grounded both of us.

I get to the ceremony and find out that literally everyone else has a +1, not just married couples, but there are couples there who have been dating for less time than me.

I call Peggy, and get no response. I text her, same thing. So I go in and open the store. An hour before her shift was supposed to be **over**, she calls me back.

So I ask her why she didn't call me as soon as she knew she needed the day off. Her response: ""I didn't have enough spoons in my drawer for that."".  

Frankly, IDK what that means. But it seems to me like she's saying she cannot be trusted to handle the responsibility of opening the store in the AM.  

So I told her that she had two choices:  

1) Go back to her old position, with her old pay.  

2) I fire her completely.  

She's calling me all sorts of ""-ist"" now, and says I'm discriminating against her due to her poor mental health and her gender. 

None of this would have been a problem if she simply took 2 minutes to call out. I would have got up and opened the store on time. But this no-call/no-show shit is not the way to run a successful business. 

I think I might be the AH here, because I **am** taking away her promotion over something she really had no control over.  

But at the same time, she really could have called me.

So I ask her why she didn't call me as soon as she knew she needed the day off. Her response: ""I didn't have enough spoons in my drawer for that."".  

Frankly, IDK what that means. But it seems to me like she's saying she cannot be trusted to handle the responsibility of opening the store in the AM.  

So I told her that she had two choices:  

1) Go back to her old position, with her old pay.  

2) I fire her completely.  

She's calling me all sorts of ""-ist"" now, and says I'm discriminating against her due to her poor mental health and her gender. 

None of this would have been a problem if she simply took 2 minutes to call out. I would have got up and opened the store on time. But this no-call/no-show shit is not the way to run a successful business. 

I think I might be the AH here, because I **am** taking away her promotion over something she really had no control over.  

But at the same time, she really could have called me.  


So, reddit, I leave it to you: Am I the asshole?

It's a complex situation but I'll do my best to explain.

I M45 have a bio son 'Leo', 16 from my previous relationship. I married his step mom who is a mother of two boys 'Connor',20 (deceased) and 'Derek',12. I've never had the pleasure to meet Connor who tragically passed away from a motorcycle accident. Derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  I've seen tons of pictures and videos of Connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share Derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. It's safe to say that Derek and I grew a strong bond in no time. But my son Leo isn't close to Derek. Understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. Leo and Derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but Leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about Derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'Advice'. Derek never complained so I had to step in and tell Leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding Conner and his memory. Leo would say ""OK I get it"" and ""I won't do it again"".

Days ago, Leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked Derek if he wanted to join. Derek agreed and put on Connor's hoodie before going out. Leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but Derek insisted on wearing it or not go. Leo dropped it.

Hours later Derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. He said Leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. I was furious I asked Leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since Derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. I reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said ""so what, maybe this will help him move on in life"". I told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.
He pitched a fit saying his birthday was a right not a privilege and I can't cancel it. He had my ex criticize my decision and wanted to host his birthday party but I refused because he's grounded so no party anywhere. She and her family called me awful and ridiculous and asked me to think how Leo will hate me for this but I insisted he needed punishment for putting his stepbrother through this.

Here’s the important background my daughter in law (32) and son(33) have 3 children aged 3 years 2 years and 4 months . He convinced her to be a stay at home mom and sell her business by telling her how good of a childhood he had and how happy my marriage was without telling her (which I today found out) that our arrangement was everything everything before 9am and
After 5pm was split 50/50, Sunday was my day off and I was brought out twice a week. 


On to the story- on my last visit I noticed my daughter in law was  struggling mentally so I,my sister(55f) and her girlfriend (53) pulled our money together and paid for a spa weekend for them while we’d babysit the kids for her birthday last weekend. 

I was preparing on Thursday evening  for the kids to arrive when my dil rang me holding back tears saying they’d won’t be going because my sons friend came to town and he said he wanted to spend the weekend with his friends catching up. I pressed her a little and I’m talking a little about her situation , she came clean about him doing no chores,no date nights and her basically doing all of the child care because “that’s what stay at home moms do” I was honestly disgusted. I convinced her to drop me off the kids and bring a friend to the spa I even dipped into my savings to give her €500 to buy herself something nice. When she dropped me off the kids I begged her to tell me were son was after 5 minutes she told me the bar. She left for the spa while I left for the bar (she knew I was going there and knew my sister/my sister in law were taking care of the kids) 

Here’s were I might be the asshole I when to the bar were he and his friends were, I sat down next to the Group and asked my son “did i fail you as a mother or was it your father because we both thought your partner comes before your silly drunk friends” the post is getting long enough but long story short I humiliated him and got myself banned from a bar 

My dil said she will taking the kids to her parents when she gets back tomorrow and my son is calling me an asshole for humiliating him/ sticking my nose in his marriage 
Maybe I should have stayed out i don’t know


Edit I just wanted to say I’m heartbroken not by any judgement towards me or my parenting skills but the fact a lot of people are shocked I’m care about my daughter in laws mental health and stood up for her against my sons bad  behaviour I just want to say as a mother my advice is

We've lived together most of our lives and are a family. She and I were extremely close.

She developed cancer when she was 14 and was sick for about 2 years. She's since made a full recovery. During that time, my parents became understandably over-protective. They also asked a lot of me. I quit my extracurriculars so I could get a job (the money went towards her medical bills) and so I could drive her to appointments. I didn't go to dances and any fun activities I did needed to include her. I did almost all of this willingly, the exception being having to quit my high school volleyball team - I did throw a bit of a tantrum about that, but was swiftly punished. And I think having one emotional breakdown was pretty chill given the circumstances.

Anyhow, I go to college and meet my ex, we'll call him Ben, when I'm a junior. We fall in love, blah blah blah. He and I move in together when we graduate, so we've been living together for about 3 years. We were serious until July when I walked into my bedroom and saw him fucking my sister.

I broke it off, tears were shed, he moved out, etc. My sister apologized at first but then backed off. I thought she was giving me space but last week she called and asked if we could meet up. She told me that she and Ben were in love and were just telling me as a courtesy before they started posting photos online. Distraught,  I left her in the restaurant by herself and did not pay my portion of the bill. She later venmo'ed me asking for the money.

She told my parents who then called me to their house, telling me how disappointed in me they are for not supporting my sister's relationship with Ben. They brought up the fact that because she had cancer as a teenager, she never learned proper social etiquette, and has a hard time meeting people. I don't buy this, in part because I've seen her socialize just fine and since we spent a good chunk of the time she was sick together, that would also mean that I should have bad social skills as well, by that logic. They then told me that if I don't accept my sister and Ben's relationship, they may have to go no contact with me. I reminded them that I'm also their daughter and they should understand my point of view, but they are adamant that this is about me being jealous of her.

For the record: I'm not jealous of her. I'm not upset that Ben picked her over me. I'm sad about the end of the relationship and do feel betrayed, but lord knows that I don't want to be with a cheater. What I'm upset about is the fact that my sister chose Ben over me. That she slept with Ben knowing he and I were in a long-term, committed relationship, and continues to be with him knowing how much it hurts me.

Now no one in my immediate family is talking to me and I'm getting messages from aunts and uncles and cousins telling me that I'm an asshole and a selfish bitch.

Edit: Thank you everyone so much for your comments. This has gotten more attention than I expected and am having trouble keeping up, so if I don't say thank you, then thank you. I've been given a lot of food for thought. TBH, while I've had moments where I've been resentful or upset about my teenage years, I've always thought that I did the right thing for my sister and for my family. And that time wasn't all miserable; I was very close to my sister and we made things as fun as we could. But I didn't think of it as an abdication of my parent's responsibilities or that they were doing wrong by me, which many of you pointed out. I definitely have a lot to think about.

Thank you again for making me feel less crazy about all of this!

I (28F) do babysitting on the weekends to make some babysitting on the weekends to make extra cash. There is one family I definitely should've fazed out by now but the kids are cute and if I don't have another job, it's easy money. My issue is, the mom is never home on time. She used to not give me return times but finally I started asking as it made it impossible to get anything done on the weekends. I'd go babysit so she could go to ""brunch"" but she'd be gone from 11 AM to 7 PM. My whole day was gone. After that, she'd start giving me times but never stick to them. She wouldn't even call to tell me, she'd just stay out.

On Saturday, I got to her house at 6 and she was supposed to be home by 9. I told her she needed to be on time because I had plans to go out with friends. I was even getting ready at their house after I put the kids to be. She promised. Of course, 9:00 rolls around and she's not home. I call her, no response. Text, no response. Another hour. Nothing. Still calling and texting. Finally, it is midnight. By this point, my plans are long ruined but I'm pissed and exhausted. I call her and leave a voicemail saying if she's not home in the next hour, I'm considering the kids abandoned and calling the cops. I also text her this. I try calling her 30 minutes later and it goes to voicemail on the second ring, I text her again and she leaves me on read. If she had reached out saying ""Hey, I'm staying out until x time"", I would've stayed. I don't know any of her family nor the father of the kids so I can't call them. I gave her a grace period of 15 minutes and tried calling again, finally called the cops (non-emergency line).

I am awoken at 3 AM by a frantic call. It's her. Where are the kids? Why am I not here? I tell her I followed through on my threat, check the police station. She cursed me out, I hung up and went to bed.

I (28F) do babysitting on the weekends to make some babysitting on the weekends to make extra cash. There is one family I definitely should've fazed out by now but the kids are cute and if I don't have another job, it's easy money. My issue is, the mom is never home on time. She used to not give me return times but finally I started asking as it made it impossible to get anything done on the weekends. I'd go babysit so she could go to ""brunch"" but she'd be gone from 11 AM to 7 PM. My whole day was gone. After that, she'd start giving me times but never stick to them. She wouldn't even call to tell me, she'd just stay out.

On Saturday, I got to her house at 6 and she was supposed to be home by 9. I told her she needed to be on time because I had plans to go out with friends. I was even getting ready at their house after I put the kids to be. She promised. Of course, 9:00 rolls around and she's not home. I call her, no response. Text, no response. Another hour. Nothing. Still calling and texting. Finally, it is midnight. By this point, my plans are long ruined but I'm pissed and exhausted. I call her and leave a voicemail saying if she's not home in the next hour, I'm considering the kids abandoned and calling the cops. I also text her this. I try calling her 30 minutes later and it goes to voicemail on the second ring, I text her again and she leaves me on read. If she had reached out saying ""Hey, I'm staying out until x time"", I would've stayed. I don't know any of her family nor the father of the kids so I can't call them. I gave her a grace period of 15 minutes and tried calling again, finally called the cops (non-emergency line). They showed up and I showed our agreement in text from earlier in the week confirming that she'd be home by 9. They try contacting her, didn't answer.

I told Leah immediately to get out, she tried to argue but I told her if she didn’t then I’m calling the police.

I asked her to hold out her hand and I took the ring off. She begged saying she is sorry and she’ll cut Leah off etc. I told her I can’t even trust her with the garage code, how am I supposed to trust her as my wife. She’s locked herself in our room now. I’m in the kitchen packing up her things. I called her dad/mom telling them about what has happened and they were furious. Leah is apparently banned from their house and has been since HS. I didn’t know this but her parents said it’s been like this since Hs. They are coming this weekend to get Erica and the stuff. I couldn’t be any happier than I am right now.

Me (29M) and Erica (27F) dated for 2 years and have been engaged the last 4 months. After we got engaged Erica moved into my house. I still pay the mortgage while she pays for utilities, Groceries and household items. After we get married the plan is to put her on the house so she gets equity as well. Her friend Leah (27F) and her have been best friend since high school. I don’t particularly like Leah but have also been cordial as I know she’s gonna be in my life. My issue is Leah thinks of my home as hers. Couple examples…

She always brings her boyfriend over and he’s a sketchball. She talks to me in a very disrespectful way in my own house, like I’m a guest and she/Erica own it. One day I went out to my garage and some of my tools were missing. I checked my camera and Leah/BF were in my garage with Erica and took some tools with them. I asked Erica and she said they were just borrowing and would return them. I had to reach out multiple times for them to finally return the tools weeks later. I have a nice wine/liquor collection and I was working late one Friday. While working I heard some clanking of bottles together. Erica wasn’t home so I went out to see what was up. Leah was behind my bar. I asked what she was doing and she said that Erica told her it was okay to borrow a bottle of wine for her party and that she would pay it back. I told her no that wasn’t alright and to leave. I asked Erica about this and she said “I don’t remember telling Leah she could take a bottle but I might have I don’t remember”. I told her at this point I wasn’t comfortable with Leah being in my house, Erica sorta understood but also blew me off. 

Final straw came when I wanted to go hit some golf balls and my clubs were missing. I freaked out because i golf regularly and my clubs are my biggest investment. Went to check the camera again and Leah used my garage code and took the clubs. I blew up, called Erica and told her to get them back immediately. Erica said Leah had asked for the garage code to grab some clothes from her closet and not my clubs. I threatened to call the police but Erica stopped me. Leah kept telling us that her boyfriend needed them for a work thing. I got them back almost 4 days after they were taken and they were dirty. At this point I sat Erica down and told her that if I see Leah in my house again then I’m calling the cops, no discussion. Erica got upset saying that it’s her best friend and that wasn’t fair to do to her in our house. I said it’s a pattern and since Erica’s stuff isn’t affected she doesn’t care. I said she can go over to Leah’s if she wants to see her. She said she can’t do this because Leah doesn’t like her apartment and Leah’s BF is always there which makes Erica uncomfortable.

It’s honestly been hell. I have a stupid name and since we were little my parents have forced stuff like Harry Potter, Star Wars, marvel movies, etc etc down our throats. Everything is about dragons and magic and blah blah blah. I’m so sick of it. Every birthday every holiday everything is just organized around “fandom.”

So just like every Christmas the days leading up to Christmas we have to sit down every night and watch Harry Potter movies. It’s. So. Fucking. BORING!!!! I can usually get away with knitting or drawing on my Ipad during this but this year my mom was like “let’s just have a technology and distraction free night every night”

I arranged to go over to my friend Missy’s house instead for like two nights. Missy’s family is NORMAL and likes things a NORMAL amount. My mom got really mad and started talking about how it’s a family tradition and how I’m basically rejecting her and went on her whole thing about how “you wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for harry potter.”

I finally had it and just yelled “NOBODY CARES THAT YOU WERE A BIG NAME IN THE HARRY POTTER FAN CLUB!!! I don’t like Harry Potter! I don’t like Star Wars! I HATE MARVEL MOVIES THEY’RE ALL SO BORING PLEASE JUST LET ME HAVE MY OWN INTERESTS!”

I couldn’t help it I started crying because I was just so frustrated because everything always has to be about harry potter this star wars that and now that we’re all older they started doing game of thrones. EVERYTHING is centered around some kind of movie or tv show or book series. 

Just onces I want my family to band around something that DOESN’T have to do with media or these nerdy things. We live in Utah where we have like 5 National Parks and even though I ask every year for my birthday I’VE NEVER EVEN BEEN TO ARCHES!!!! 

Well my sister called me saying that mom was angry and to just come home and to stop with the theatrics.

I wanna preface this by saying that I f34 married my husband m37 a year ago. His mom is snoopy and annoying af. She can't help it that is just how she is as my dear in laws say.


My husband and I purchased a new house recently. My MIL kept pushing to get an emergency key, She promised that she only use it in an emergency but giving the fact that she had an emergency key to our old apartment and walked in on us being intimate twice (but my husband didn't think it was big deal) I just couldn't trust her so I just sent her a fake key (after she kept pushing) and she had a smug on her face after I hand delivered it to her.


Days gone by and on Christmas dinner MIL angerily ""called me out"" on the fact I gave her a fake copy of the house key. She shamed me for doing this in front of everyone but in my defensive I asked her how she found out and she said days ago when she came over at 4 while my husband and were out. I reminded her ""didn't you promise you wouldn't use it unless there's an emergency? So You tried to get in when there was no emergency and you broke the promise you made to us!"" She looked red in the face and the other family started staring and some even laughed at her for the face she made. She suddenly got up from her seat and rushed into the kitchen where she had a huge meltdown so loud the next door neighbors must've heard - literally I've never heard a 60+ year old woman throw a tantrum like that. Needless to say dinner went awkward and my husband and his sister were giving me looks. My husband went off on me in the car and said I lied and manipulated and humiliated and exposed his mom and said he wouldn't have let me get away with it had he known. We had an argument and he is demanding I apologize to his mom for my childish behavior and for ruining Christmas dinner for the whole family.

AITA?

Eta so this went off unexpectedly and I thought I'd show my husband some pretty helpful comments I found here minutes ago but he got mad at me when he saw it and said I was nuts to talk about his family online. He demanded my phone so he could delete it but I refused and I went upstairs and into the bedroom. I never seen him so agitated and I didn't think he'd react like that honestly. But thank you guys for your support. It really means so much. I'll update if I can. Thanks again :)","AITA for giving my MIL a fake copy of my house key and ""exposing"" her on Christmas dinner?

On one occasion I followed her as she went upstairs (i was going to get something for my child as the bedrooms are upstairs) and she walked past the bathroom on the main floor and up the stairs behind it.  She didn’t hear me and I caught her walking straight into my room and rifling through bills on my dresser.  She denied snooping (even though I’d just watched her do it) and said she was just going to use our bathroom because she couldn’t find the other ones. She walked right past the one on the main floor and another one in the upstairs hallway to go into our bedroom. Since that happened, I installed an exterior doorknob that requires a key on our bedroom door and one on the door to our office/spare bedroom. 

However, she’s still always “forgetting” where the bathroom is and trying the bedroom and office door.  This really ticks me off.  My husband says that I just get annoyed at this because everything she does drives me crazy and since we’ve put locks on the rooms we don’t want her in, there isn’t really a problem anymore.  

Well over the holidays we had my in laws over for dinner and before they came I was searching for the bedroom keys. We hadn’t used them in a while since we only lock the doors when MIL comes over.  My husband told me we didn’t need to lock the doors since she wouldn’t try to get into the rooms and I insisted that she would because she loves to snoop.  We went back and forth and decided to cover the doorknobs in super fine glitter to see if she tried them.  

I did this once before when husband didn’t believe me about the snooping to prove she’d been in the rooms.  Last time she ignored the glitter and we didn’t say anything about it but then my husband couldn’t deny that she’d tried to snoop.  So this time I covered the knobs in glitter and for the office went a touch further and rigged a little folder of glitter over the door to the office before the in laws came over.  I left it one side unlocked (French doors) and it was set so if you walked in the room you would get covered in glitter. 

Husband goes out of his way to show his mom the main floor bathroom when they got here and specifically asks his parents and sister not to go upstairs.  There’s a  baby gate so the kids can’t get upstairs either. 

Well guess who had to go to the bathroom and got covered in glitter and had it all over their hands and hair?  She completely lost it and started screaming at me so I yelled back and now my husband is saying I went too far and I’m the asshole.  MIL also says I’m the asshole but SIL says I didn’t do anything wrong and MIL deserved it for snooping.  FIL is Switzerland.  Apparently her car is ruined now too because it’s covered in glitter that she cant get cleaned up. So AITA?

ETA: I can’t believe this blew up and I wanted to say thank you for all the support and the awards!  My husband woke up and found this post and I think the comments have been an eye opener.  We are going to start couple’s therapy in January so I think that will be great for us.  

I will be ordering some cellulose glitter that is biodegradable and safer for future projects.  

And if she comes over again I will set up a camera haha or at least print out some fun fake documents so if she snoops again she can at least find something interesting :)","AITA for setting a glitter trap to catch my mother in law trying to snoop?For some weird reason my MIL really wants to go into our bedroom whenever she comes over.  On one occasion I followed her as she went upstairs (i was going to get something for my child as the bedrooms are upstairs) and she walked past the bathroom on the main floor and up the stairs behind it.  She didn’t hear me and I caught her walking straight into my room and rifling through bills on my dresser.  She denied snooping (even though I’d just watched her do it) and said she was just going to use our bathroom because she couldn’t find the other ones. She walked right past the one on the main floor and another one in the upstairs hallway to go into our bedroom. Since that happened, I installed an exterior doorknob that requires a key on our bedroom door and one on the door to our office/spare bedroom. 

However, she’s still always “forgetting” where the bathroom is and trying the bedroom and office door.  This really ticks me off.  My husband says that I just get annoyed at this because everything she does drives me crazy and since we’ve put locks on the rooms we don’t want her in, there isn’t really a problem anymore.  

Well over the holidays we had my in laws over for dinner and before they came I was searching for the bedroom keys. We hadn’t used them in a while since we only lock the doors when MIL comes over.  My husband told me we didn’t need to lock the doors since she wouldn’t try to get into the rooms and I insisted that she would because she loves to snoop.  We went back and forth and decided to cover the doorknobs in super fine glitter to see if she tried them.

We're talking about making it a home for both of us.

But as of now, he hasn't moved much stuff in, right now 95% of the stuff and furniture in the house is mine. 

When his mom comes over, she's kind of a snoop. He was used to that, but when she comes to our house, it's so uncomfortable because she's just going through my shit. 

When I am bothered, she's like ""I was just helping with chores"" etc. He says I should just let her because she has ""a lot of nervous energy"" 

One thing she snooped on was actually embarrassing. In my home office, I had a little ""affirmation"" post it note on my monitor saying ""I am smart, I am skilled, I am deserving of great things"" It was a silly thing my therapist recommended to get me in a confident mindset before an interview. 

Anyway, she made a comment to about my ego... 

But as a joke, I decided to do it again. I had my best friend over and we got wine drunk and wrote a bunch of ""affirmations"" to hide.

Some were:

Medicine cabinet: My teeth will regrow! I am sharklike and powerful!

Kitchen drawers: I know when to spoon, but I also know when to fork! I am sexy and self assured!

Work desk: I will not just fuck my way to the top of the company, I will fuck my way to the top of the world! 

Walk in closet: I am beautiful with clothes and without! Especially without! My boobs are legendary!

Next time my MIL came over she saw a few. And she didn't acknowledge them to me even though she definitely started acting a little weird about me. 

I went to run some errands and when I was out, she confronted Al about the notes and was trying to tell him that I seemed unstable, egotistical, and moving in was a bad idea. She showed him the notes and he didn't really know what to make of it. 

He asked me and I said that they were just some silly private notes to boost my self confidence and make myself laugh; how had she gotten them? Had she been going through my things? 

He said she was just tidying, and saw them. And they were real weird.

I was like 'have you met me? You should know how weird I am. Anyway if you don't want your mom seeing my weird shit you've got to stop letting her go through my shit""

He asked if I left them on purpose to annoy her, and I admitted that was kinda the joke, but I also have other weird or private shit so what I said about her needing to stop snooping if she didn't want to find weird crap was still for real.

He said I was making stuff hard for him, his mom was really protective and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, and I was agitating her on purpose and making her think I wouldn't be a good partner, when he wanted her to have the opposite impression of me!

I visited my parents house to celebrate my sister's birthday and my husband couldn't come with me because he was busy, after the party we all sat down for dinner and my sister's boyfriend said it was weird that my husband and I don't have kids despite being married for 6 years now, I was shocked that he brought this up but I gave a short answer stating that it's because of infertility issues, he asked on which side and I didn't wanna answer but my sister said it's on my side. I got uncomfortable as he looked at me for a second and said that maybe not having kids now is a good thing because he thought women over 30 might ""produce"" defective babies due to age.


I told him it was none of his business but he said that he was just giving his ""honest opinion"" and that's all. I, in return, told him while maintaining eye contact: ""trust me, if I wanted an asshole's opinion, I would've farted!"". Literally everyone at the table bursted into laughter and my sister and her boyfriend were stunned. Few seconds later her boyfriend excused himself out and my sister followed then sent me a text after they left saying I was mean and disrespectful towards her boyfriend and insulted him maliciously just cause he stated his honest opinion, she also said I ruined her birthday by being petty and making her boyfriend the joke of the night infront of the family. I didn't respond but she demanded an apology via mail as soon as possible, mom agreed that I shouldn't have said what I said and should've just ignored him knowing how he is.

Throwaway account because she uses reddit. 
My (M25) girlfriend (F30) Nat has a very particular sense of style. Picture Harley Finkle from wizards of waverly place, you will get the idea. 
Don’t get me wrong, i never had a problem with that! In fact, i love the way she dresses because she loves to do so, and i am happy if she is happy. The thing is, sometimes she likes to incorporate memes into her clothes. No problem. It’s cute. But now she wants to wear a dress inspired on the meme “gay rat wedding”. To my friend’s wedding. He and his fiancé are gay. I told her, maybe that is not really appropriated? The dress in question would be full of little stuffed rats, pride flags and a big “I SUPPORT GAY RATS” on the front. 
My friend is not a big fan of the way my GF dresses and i think this dress may cause an certain uproar in the wedding. Now, nat is upset with me and claiming that i am “throwing water in her flame of creativity”. 
The wedding is next month, so she has plenty of time to think about another thing to wear. Should i just let her go with the dress? Am i the asshole in this situation?





UPDATE:

well guys, as many of you pointed out in the comments, me getting a throwaway account didn’t help. She found the post. Guess i was too specific after all. I will update soon




FINAL UPDATE:

Hello everyone! I would like to thank you all for your judgment, advices and opinions on my post, it was greatly appreciated! So… the conversation did not go well. She was livid with me for exposing her in this way, and although i showed her the comments (most important, the ones from the LGBTQIA community) she refused to admit that her dress was a poor choice, but in fact, her way to “appreciate the gays”. That did not sit well with me. Love can move mountains, but can NOT maintain a relationship with a homophobic. So, now i am going to the wedding a single, rat-free-dress, man! I did reach out to my friend and send him this post. He thought the situation to be hilarious, but if she did show up in the dress, he would def kick us to the curb. I guess this is all!

We were really really happy and told our families, and now my mom and MIL want to throw a big baby shower for us, it was just super good news all around. 

Well 2 nights ago me and Jake were getting ready for bed when he reminds me to go through the house and make sure all the lights are off. Now he can be a little lazy at times, and it has become a nightly routine for me to make sure all the lights are off that he leaves on before we go to bed. I wasn't feeling very well and asked if he could just do it since he wasn't doing anything and was literally standing by the door. He then tells me ""No, this is what is expected of you every night."" I was a little hurt but I didn't want to fight with him so I just did it. When I came back Jake goes on this very long and unprovoked rant saying things like ""Just because you are pregnant does not mean anything will change"" and ""You are still expected to cook, clean, and do all the chores every day because how can you be expected to be a mother if you can't handle a little work."" He wasn't yelling or anything, he was talking to me quietly like a was 2 inches tall. 

I was shocked because I had never heard him say anything like this. The rant went on for about 30 minutes before I interjected and asked ""Well what do you plan on doing to help me with all of this."" He then got extremely defensive saying he works his ass of at his job to provide for me and what is going to be our future children. (For context I don't work atm, my job was not paying enough to justify me going so I am a full time college student) He ended by saying that it doesn't matter how I feel physically or mentally, it is a mothers job to push through, and if he helped and babied me I wouldn't be a good mother.

I got extremely upset and started yelling and I said that ""I wish I would've known this is how you felt before I got pregnant with your baby."" There was a moment of silence before he started crying and he left for the night to stay at his mothers house. He hasn't been back yet and my MIL and SIL have called me berating me and saying I broke Jakes heart with what I said and I need to apologize immediately, and until I do he isn't coming home. I don't know how to feel. 

So AITA for yelling at my husband after he said he isn't helping me with anything during the pregnancy because ""its a mothers job to deal with it""?

My mom is furious with him and doesn't want me apologizing to him or talking to him without the situation either being recorded or having a witness. Regardless, I am ok and will be ok.

It's mean to say but it's true. He can never hang onto a job for longer than a couple years max and when he inevitably loses whatever job he had he starts mooching off family and friends until he can find another job months later. This entails him freeloading at their place, eating their food, using their stuff, etc. He's lost friends because of how long he bummed off of them and I don't blame them for cutting him off.

Well this last time he lost his job he went to our parents but they didn't have room because they were letting our eldest brother's (EB) family stay with them after he and SIL lost their jobs out of nowhere within the same month (EB's entire crew was laid off with zero warning and SIL's work burned down) and they couldn't afford the home they were renting anymore. So OB was pretty much SOL. So our parents, aunt, and uncle all started calling me asking if I'd take him in just long enough so he could get on his feet again.

I (stupidly) let myself feel bad for him and said okay, but he only had a few months to get another job or he was out on the street. They all said of course, of course and so he came to stay with me. And it was a nightmare. He's a slob. He NEVER washes dishes, never washes his clothes, and eats pretty much whatever he wants. I guess since I'm his little sister he figured he could ignore me saying to get his shit together. Well after 6 months I told him he had to go. And gave him a couple weeks to find somewhere else.

Well it seems he called our parents and cried about me kicking him out and they told him he knew he couldn't stay forever but they also ofc called my aunts/uncle and told them all about it. And my busybody aunt called me and scolded me for ""being cruel to my brother"" and ""abandoning family when they need help"". I let her talk and finally said she was right, helping family was important and I'm glad she showed me that. She seemed glad I ""understood the right thing to do"" before hanging up. So I followed her advice and packed my bro up and drove him to her house. I couldn't take care of him anymore (he was running all my bills up) but my aunt made a good point, family should help each other.

So I dropped him off there (she has room since all her kids moved out) and then left. But I wasn't even halfway home before I was getting multiple calls from my parents and aunt. Parents were demanding to know why our aunt was blowing up their phones and aunt was leaving voicemails shouting at me to come back and get my brother. I explained to my parents and they said it was a good idea since aunt sounded like she wanted to help but my aunt called me an asshole and said she didn't want my brother there. And when I told her family helps each other she called me a cunt. Last I checked he's still living with her. AITA?

Sorry for my lack of replies! I answered what ones I could before I left for work and when I got back I had far too many to answer.

Lots of people have been asking similar questions so I thought answering them here once would be helpful.

1. My brother doesn't work menial jobs, he's not just hopping from one minimum wage job to another. He's working Very Good paying jobs. Like electronic repair, automotive maintenance, etc. He's very skilled but lazy.
2. No my aunt hasn't spoken to me since she called me a cunt then hung up on me.
3. My brother has only been with her about 3-ish weeks. He stayed with me for 6-7 months.
4. My brother was upset I was kicking him out initially but in a better mood when he realized I had another place lined up for him to stay. Not sure how they're doing together since I haven't talked to either since after I dropped him off.
5. No my aunt isn't married anymore, her and my uncle got divorced and he lives with his new wife (but I heard from dad that he thought this all was hilarious).

\- Edit 2 -

To everyone who has been hounding me through PM and in the comments, my brother isn't (last time we checked) neurodivergent nor does he have ADD or ADHD. Our mom took him to the doctor more than once around when he was 15-17 when his behavior was at its worst. 

According to our mom the doctors all said he was perfectly healthy and fine, though they (the doctors) suggested he wasn't being mentally stimulated enough (aka he was bored?). Mom wanted to take him to see other doctors but by then he'd turned 18 and refused to go and she couldn't force him.

Also its been suggested he maybe see a doctor now but my OB doesn't seem at all interested. He's never had the highest respect for doctors or mental illness. He treats it like it's fake. When our baby sister was diagnosed with an ED when she was 19 he just cracked a joke about her just wanting a doctor's note so she could eat more...","AITA for dropping my freeloading brother off at our aunt's house after she called and scolded me for evicting him?My older brother (OB) is... a bit of a bum. It's mean to say but it's true. He can never hang onto a job for longer than a couple years max and when he inevitably loses whatever job he had he starts mooching off family and friends until he can find another job months later. This entails him freeloading at their place, eating their food, using their stuff, etc. He's lost friends because of how long he bummed off of them and I don't blame them for cutting him off.

So I started a new job recently I work in small studio, there are several others in the building, think open plan office with sections assigned to each studio. The person I had an altercation with doesn't work for my studio just FYI. 

I eat lunch at 1ish and most people eat at 12. I came down ealry to eat at 12, I made coffee and while at the counter noticed my tuppaware in the sink, empty. 

Imagine my surprise when I turned around and saw a man I didn't know sitting down at the table with my food on his plate. He had just stuck it in the microwave. Acting rashly since I was mad, I sat down next to him and said 'hey that looks good, mind if I try it?' Then before waiting for an answer I yanked the plate away from him and snatched his fork out his hand, he just blinked in shock as did the other people there as I started eating.

He then, quite loudly, asked what I thought I was doing and I replied 'huh you know this was actually much better when I first cooked it, it probably lost some flavor in the fridge.' he caught on quickly that it was it was my food and went a lil red. I then asked him where he got the gall to steal someone else's lunch and then ask them what they were doing when they took it back.

He stuttered out some nonsense about not knowing it was mine and I replied well you knew it wasn't yours right? He just mumbled something like an apology and I said that's no problem it was nice he'd warmed it up for me at least, in an admittedly b*tchy tone, and then he just got up and left and the people there just stared in silence. 2 of the silent watchers, maybe his mates idk, told me that I was rude to him and that there had been nicer ways to go about it. I told them to think how they'd feel if someone ate their food before saying they should focus on their lunch and I'll focus on mine.

Well it's been a little awkward at lunch since and I have the impression a few people are talking shite about me at work now, maybe I could've been nicer sure. I still don't think I was wrong but tell me reddit AITA

Update: So not sure if anyone wanted an update but I finally found out from a a new friend at work that yes the lunch thief has struck before! Apparently everyone wrote their names on their lunch to combat this, and the thief then targeted unmarked lunch or lunch items, guess no one told me ha. 

People apparently starting being petty and standoff-ish to the thief since and he blames me for that lol. Also according to my new friend most were actually very pleased that the thief was finally identified/dealt with.

I was assured that besides the thief in question and his cronies no one thought I was being a b*tch. However, not knowing much about me, assumed I was a very serious or clique-y person from my reaction, which I mean fair, I dress very professionally when most of the office dresses quite casual which probably added to that (think high heels, blouse and skirt VS shorts, graphic tee and slops).

Hi. I'm a new mom, had my son 5 weeks ago. my husband's parents have been staying with us and things have been super overwhelming.


MIL has a habit of taking the baby and refusing to give him back to me. She'd say I'm deliberately ruining her time with him. My son needs feeding every 2hrs and she basically makes me beg her to hand him over to me so I could feed.

last night at 10PM. MIL had my son in her arms while sitting on the couch with my husband and his dad. I was exhausted, the baby started crying. I told my MIL to hand him over to me so I could feed him. She refused and I kept asking. my husband starts talking about what a whinny little girl I was to complain that our son is receiving love and cuddles and how I'm using feeding as an excuse to keep the baby away from his mom. I ignored him and told his mom to hand over the baby. she refused and said I needed to wait a little longer.

I got angry at this point, My husband said I could take the baby after I ask his mom nicely. This had me seething I meanly told his mom to stop being annoying and overbearing and hand him over to me. She looked at me shocked and hurt. She handed the baby over and ran into the guest room and my husband gave me a look than followed her and stayed inside to comfort her.


He came into the room while I was feeding my son and started yelling about how disrespectful I was to speak to his mom this way and treat her poorly when all she's doing is showing our son more love than I do. I told him about how she's been taking the baby for hours and preventing me from feeding him properly. he said that 1, our son isn't an object for me to act like I own him and 2, his mom was doing nothing wrong and 3, I should've asked nicely instead of being a bi$ch to his mom and making her cry. I started crying and yelled that I'd go to my mom's place if his parents stay any longer and he yelled back saying ""shut the fuck up, you're only acting up cause you don't want my parents around! fuck's wrong with you?"" then walked out. I felt terrible thinking maybe I was rude to his mom but I also think that I'd hit my limits here.
AITA for not asking her nicely like my husband wanted?

Edit; some mistakes because my hands are a bit unsteady.","AITA for not asking my MIL nicely to hand over the baby for feeding?

My sister got knocked up by her boyfriend right out of highschool, got married the next year, then proceeded to pop out another baby every year or two, so she has four now at 24. She's a stay at home mom even though she was brilliant and could have gotten a free ride to a great University. Since hers are the only grandkids, our parents fawn over her like she's the next coming of Christ. They gush over over every new tooth or haircut like it's some huge achievement.

Problem is, her husband's business wasn't great even even before COVID, and is barely limping along now. Sister doesn't work, and my parents have limited income. So guess who's constantly being told to ""lend"" them money for shit like school fees, car seat, car payment, new  stroller, etc. They don't even ask! My mom just texts me ""your sister needs $X.XX for the kids"" and I'm supposed to cough up. If I complain, they accuse me of being  jealous because I don't have a husband and family even though I'm older (I'm only 26!)

So over Easter I notice my sister isn't drinking and I think oh god, here we go again. Sure enough, she stands up and announces that she's been inseminated with yet another precious miracle.  Everyone's gushing and I just try to stay quiet and out of the way. 

Later she asks me if everything's alright and I try to play it off but she pushes so I asked her if she and her husband could really afford another baby. She very snippily replies ""God will provide like he has so far,"" which really pissed me off. I yelled that no, actually god didn't provide for her babies, **I** did, and I wasn't going to giving them any more handouts. It devolved into a big argument with everyone shouting at me, and basically I've been banned from my family unless I apologize. I haven't apologized. 

It's been radio silence except for one text from my mom saying that if my sister miscarries it's my fault for stressing her out. I asked if my sister was showing any symptoms but no one will answer or tell me. IDK. I don't think I'm TA but I don't want to be the reason she miscarries.

So guess who's constantly being told to ""lend"" them money for shit like school fees, car seat, car payment, new  stroller, etc. They don't even ask! My mom just texts me ""your sister needs $X.XX for the kids"" and I'm supposed to cough up. If I complain, they accuse me of being  jealous because I don't have a husband and family even though I'm older (I'm only 26!)

So over Easter I notice my sister isn't drinking and I think oh god, here we go again. Sure enough, she stands up and announces that she's been inseminated with yet another precious miracle.  Everyone's gushing and I just try to stay quiet and out of the way. 

Later she asks me if everything's alright and I try to play it off but she pushes so I asked her if she and her husband could really afford another baby. She very snippily replies ""God will provide like he has so far,"" which really pissed me off. I yelled that no, actually god didn't provide for her babies, **I** did, and I wasn't going to giving them any more handouts. It devolved into a big argument with everyone shouting at me, and basically I've been banned from my family unless I apologize. I haven't apologized. 

It's been radio silence except for one text from my mom saying that if my sister miscarries it's my fault for stressing her out. I asked if my sister was showing any symptoms but no one will answer or tell me. IDK. I don't think I'm TA but I don't want to be the reason she miscarries. Also, I think I might be TA because secretly I think it would be better if she did even though I wouldn't say that to her.",False,False,AmItheAsshole,AITA For not being happy that my sister is pregnant AGAIN?,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/u84njt/aita_for_not_being_happy_that_my_sister_is/,2022,-0.7432

My daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people. 

He said no because the teacher had said ""about"" four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that ""you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules"" and she said she didn't care. 

I heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind.

I sent her an email saying..

Dear Mrs. (Teacher)

I'm sorry, but that is not a lesson I feel comfortable teaching my daughter. 

She's at the age where she is already having to deal with unwanted attention, and I'm making a point to teach her that she does not have to be around anyone who makes her uncomfortable. And that a young lady is able to choose to spend time with people who make her feel respected.

I understand you already are aware (Boy) has been behaving in ways that she feels uncomfortable with at recess, from our prior conversations.

I think it is a very dangerous lesson to teach a girl she has to include and be kind to everyone, instead of teaching her to be aware of when someone is not respecting her ""No"" and stepping out of the situation.

I hope I don't have to explain in too much detail why I find this important... But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the ""Include everyone"" mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say ""No"" to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age. 

Thank you,

She emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal. I'm preparing for that but wondering if my email was too harsh

Edit to update...

I reached out to the parents of the other four girls in the class who were involved, and we all coordinated to go speak to the school administration together. They had similar views, thinking it was inappropriate for the school to expect the girls work with someone who they're not comfortable with, and frustrated the teacher didn't do more to deal with the issues during recess that made the girls uncomfortable to start with. 

I ended up asking the school if we could reschedule the meeting to a time all the involved families could make, and we ended up meeting this afternoon along with my husband, another couple, two mothers, and a father. Along with the teacher and principal. 

We all presented a united front asking for the following...

The school does training for the teachers on trauma-informed teaching methods and the dangers of expecting young women to go against their best judgement of their own boundaries to be ""nice"". Instead of ""Include everyone"" the kids should be allowed to respectfully set boundaries and taught to respect each other's boundaries.

The school addresses harassment in class or at recess and doesn't enable it to continue. 

We went to talk, and I think it went a lot better having all the parents join instead of if I'd gone alone. The teacher and principal apologized and the principal agreed to look for resources on how to better navigate the balance between being inclusive and not forcing kids into including someone who is crossing a line with them.

Thanks a lot for all the amazing advice in the comments, I cannot believe how much this blew up and I'm so grateful to everyone who replied with advice and support.

My husband and I have been married for 6 years. Still don't have kids (we want them but it still not happening). Friends and family are causing us constant stress about having a baby soon but it's obviously something we can't control. We only wished that they'd stop but to no avail.

So what I did was come up with idea (stupid I know) and that is have an empty jar and call it ""Pregnancy Jar"". I carry it with me in my bag whenever I'm with friends and family and everytime someone asks about when my husband and I are gonna have a baby, I pull my Jar out and ask them to drop a dollar in there for asking. I'd get puzzled looks but they reach out for their pockets/wallets/purses and pull out a dollar and out it inside the jar. It actually worked because most of thrm stopped asking after 4 months.


Last week we had dinner at my parents house, My brother came back from his business trip that lasted a month and while we were eating he asked when me and my husband were going to have a kid. My husband paused, I got up from the chair and made my way to where my brother was sitting with my jar in my hand and asked him to drop a dollar for the question he asked, he stared at me then laughed nervously asking if I was being serious.  Everyone was looking at us. He said no, he didn't have to pay me but I told him he didn't have to ask either so here we are!. I could tell he felt embarrassed he immediately reached out to his pocket, pulled out his wallet and put a dollar in my jar. I made my way back to my seat and sat down and resumed eating like nothing happened. It got awkward afterward. Mom pulled me into the kitchen later to tell me that I embarrassed my brother infront of his wife and family and said I should quit acting childish by running around with a jar demanding others to put money in it, I told her they should quit asking then. She went on about how they're just worried for us since we are in mid 30s and don't have much time left if we want at least one healthy baby. I got upset and she started arguing. My husband and I left and we haven't seen them in days, except I got a call from my sister basically siding with mom and the others saying I'm being childish.


So AITA for this?

(1) this has been going on for years but in the past year it has gotten worse. 

(2) I already told them about how I feel regarding this question, my husband doesn't care much and says I should let it go too.

(3) Yes they pay everytime because it's just a dollar, it won't make me any richer or them any poorer.

(4) My husband and I spend the money on snacks to eat every night when watching tv or some toys for the dogs.

A few weeks ago my 10yro started telling me that his cousin was bullying him and being mean to him. He called him names, pushed him around, took his video games etc. I talked to my sister many times and told her to talk to her son, we talked to the boys together and things settled down. 
Yesterday was my 3yro's birthday, so my whole family was here and my late wife's family as well. It was extremely emotional for everyone, because it was the first birthday since my wife's been gone. The boys (10yro and 9yro) started fighting again and I asked them both to calm down and behave. My son started crying and told me his cousin teased him about him not having a mom. I choked up and asked my nephew if that was true, and he said yes, but that he's sorry. I figured I'd have a proper talk with him and my sister after the party, so I just told him what he said was really awful and he cannot say it again. I comforted my son and we went back to the party.

I told her to drop it and we'll talk later, instead she said ""besides, he's right, kids need a mom"".

My in-laws were crying, I was tearing up, the kids were upset, just awful. I told her to stop it and just leave me and the kids and the family to cut the cake and we will talk in the evening. She said ""listen we both lost our spouses, but at least I'm still a normal person"". She stormed off. After the party I told her she has 2 days to pack her shit and leave. 
She is begging me not to throw her out, because she and her kid will be homeless.

I (M/37) have a 13 y.o son. I was a widower when I met my now wife. She has a 16 y.o daughter from another relationship. The family is often on pretty good terms. My son is the quiet one in the house, he keeps to himself a lot but not to the point of being concerning. My wife and stepdaughter are the complete opposit. They both encourage him to be outgoing and share activities and join gatherings with extended family. My son complained about having to be forced out of his comfort zone and having his need for space invalidated. I spoke to both my wife and stepdaughter and asked them to give him space and freedom to spend his time however he wanted. they apologized and promised to let him be.

As mother's day was approaching I wanted to throw my wife a surprise mother's day celebration. It was no longer a surprise because my stepdaughter gave her the heads so she could prepare. Yesterday I got off work earlier than usual to get final arrangements done (we planned to celebrate at the restaurant and invited her family there) I had the key and while I was entering the house through the front door I overheard my wife and stepdaughter talking to my son. My wife was asking my son if he could convince me to let him stay home and not go with them to the restaurant to celebrate. I paused and decided to keep listening. My son said why and she told him that his introverted and socially inept ""attitude"" will make her family uncomfortable and will ruin the mood. He promised her that he'd be well behaved and would try to interact and socialize with everyone but she said that she wasn't buying it. He kept reassuring her but she snapped and told him that technically, she's not his mom so she didn't get why he wanted to celebrate mother's day with her so badly. My stepdaughter threw some (I don't remember) backhanded comment and then both of them were shocked to see me standing there. Both were staring without saying anything. I told my son and his stepsister to go to their rooms then told my wife that the celebration was off, cancelled. she tried to argue asking why repeatedly and I told her why. She tried to explain that she didn't mean it like that and that I only heard part of the conversation but not all of it. I told her I was done arguing and the decision was already made. She yelled asking what she was going to tell her family and said that I was making tremendous mistake towards her.

I ignored her while she kept throwing tantrum after a tantrum. Early this morning she took my stepdaughter and went to stay with her folks. not a single call or text from her so far. Situation is full of tension. I'm upset still but more hurt to be honest. I mean yes I did say I was going to havw this celebration but I thought that what she said to my son was too harsh to ignore.","AITA for cancelling mother's day celebration that I arranged for my wife after hearing what she told my son?

Realistically, I know I'm in the clear. Legally, I'm in the clear. But I'm being vilified by my coworkers, and I'm genuinely considering quitting my job because of this mess.


So I work a pretty standard day job, and at night I help my friend at her restaurant, which serves an assortment of Thai cuisine. Tbh I'm insanely picky, but I fell in love with this peanut sauce the main chef makes, and he showed me how to make it, so about once a week I take it on either noodles or stir fry to my day job for lunch. People know this and a handful have tried it. It smells nutty, it tastes nutty. It's white girl pad Thai, basically.


Lately my lunches have been disappearing, or I'll open my lunchbox to find half of my food missing. I've tried addressing it, but nothing has been changing, and I was pretty sure it was one of the new hires that was doing it, but had no proof. Until now.



Thursday I took my noodles, and my entire tupperware was missing, which hasn't happened before. I'm pissed, but what can I do? A coworker shared her pizza with me and that was that, until today. My boss confronted me and accused me of poisoning my noodles because his daughter (one of the new girls) ""borrowed"" my lunch and had to be hospitalized. Turns out she's severely allergic to nuts, ate some and boom. Anaphylaxis.  She used an epi pen, had to be hospitalized and now her dad is trying to hold me accountable for her bills and condition, but I don't see it. Why should I pay? I don't mark my food as an allergen because I'm not allergic to it, she was just dumb enough to steal from me and eat something she can't have. 


But he's being hateful, and some of my older coworkers are icing me out because I warned him I'd report any harassment to HR if he tried anything funny. Brown nosers, I guess. My friend is aware and offered me a full time job, but I just can't help but feel it's unfair. At the same time, I could have killed his daughter tho... So, AITA?




Edit: holy shitballs this blew up!



I *did* email the HR rep and let her know of the situation. She's been on vacation and gets back tomorrow, so I don't know if she's aware of what's been going on since last week. I should note that I work weekends most weeks, not quite a 8-5 M-F job, but yeah. 



My coworkers mostly chilled out by the end of my shift, thankfully, after I explained to the (nosiest) friendlier person that I always bring a peanut sauce dish. I guess the general assumption was that I somehow found out who has been stealing lunches and decided to poison them?



To answer a common question: this was the first time my pad thai was stolen, and no I'm not the only victim of the lunch thief. I usually take a late lunch, and I'm not the only one, so I'm guessing the lady who was stealing food decided what was left is a free for all. F her. My boss said it was an HR issue when I'd tried talking to him about lunches disappearing, and HR always said they'd look into it (or further into it) and nothing ever happened. We're 100% not allowed to eat at our desks, unless you have a medical reason for it, so that wasn't an option either.



I'm assuming she's fine, but I don't know the severity of her allergy or how much she ate before she had her reaction. I'm not privy to her medical information, sorry guys.



Suing.... Sounds like a great revenge, but probably not worth the cost of a lawyer. My friend let me take tonight off to just bitch about everything, and I'm probably going to take her job offer. One commenter was right; even if everything settles down, I don't want to deal with a potentially hostile or reactive workplace like this anymore. It's not a  career with much room for upward mobility, and I didn't feel welcome in our group meeting today.


And for the people calling this fake, okay? It's not, but even if it were, why are you getting mad about it? Karma doesn't give me anything, monetarily or status. I can't exactly give out a bunch of details unless I want to dox myself, and the post seems rushed because I wrote it out of frustration during my lunch. Short time+word limit= rushed. Sorry it didn't meet your writing standards.



Anyway, I'll keep reading comments and responding occasionally, but this is it for me unless I get something worth updating. Thanks for everyone's opinions! (And the information about Caesar dressing and Worcestershire [thanks Google] having anchovies. That's crazy!)

2 tbsp cider vinegar
3/4 cup of water

I cook it on med-low heat and add more water if it seems too thick. And use regular coconut milk!! The low fat isn't as good imo



I had to find one for home that seemed similar to the restaurant's since I'm not making enough for an army! I like this one, but I'm also lazy and want it done in 15 minutes. I hope everyone likes it! If not... Well, you tried something new

My friend ""Grace"" invited me to a board game bar to play and have drinks with her, her boyfriend and one of their friend's ""Nick"".

We went to get drinks in pairs, Grace going with her boyfriend, meanwhile Nick and I stayed at the table and vice versa. So Nick and I had plenty of time to talk just the two of us. 

Nick started the night by telling about his recent career change, he decided to quit his previous job, go to a coding bootcamp and he got a job as a developer one or two months ago. He was very proud of himself and his new salary and told me this multiple times. 

He never asked me what I do for work, but talked about his new job quite a lot, occasionally saying ""sorry, you don't understand that, haha"". During the entire evening, I never told him I has been working as a software engineer for the past 4 years, because he never asked and honestly, I found it a bit entertaining. 

When it came to the drinks, he invited me to every single one. ""Don't worry about it, it's not a problem with my devoper salary."" I told him multiple times he doesn't have to pay for me, but he insisted. 

At the end of the night, when we were saying our goodbyes, he took out his phone to send me a friend request on Facebook. My job is listed in my profile, so that was when he realized that I'm software engineer. 

He asked me if it's true that I'm a software engineer and I answered yes. He asked me why I haven't told him, why did I let him believe I was a cashier like Grace used to be (?? I never implied that), and why did I let him pay for everything when I probably earn more than him. 

I told him that he never once asked and it was his fault he assumed. He could have simply asked me about my job, but he only wanted to brag about his. But if he wants me to, I can pay him back for the drinks. 

He was a angry and said I made a fool out of him. I think he did that, not me. But now Grace and her boyfriend are on his side too, saying that it would've cost me nothing to tell him early in the evening and I only kept it for myself for my own entertainment.

It was kinda awkward, I was her third choice but her family vetoed the first two because they didn't want her bringing a boy or this other female friend of hers they disliked.

Her parents bought my plane ticket and booked the resort which I was very grateful for and I saved a lot of money up so I could make sure I buy my own food and activities when I'm there, and treat her family to a dinner as a thank you for the ticket.

But when the trip started, it was just bad. It was her, me, her mother, her father, two of her father's friends, and her three brothers going. 

On the flight, they all got first class and got me a economy seat. But I didn't say anything because why argue about a free ticket?

The first night they went to a grocery, it turns out they wanted to cook at the resort kitchen for the whole trip 

And by ""they wanted to cook"" it actually turned out that they wanted me and Meg to cook. I wasn't warned about this but it turns out Meg's family is sooo ""traditional"" that they see cooking as a women's job. And her mom had just had hand surgery.

So it was me and Meg cooking every meal for six men and her mom. And I can't cook well. I know a couple staple meals to feed myself but since I rarely eat meat I don't know how to cook it. I'm also ok at cooking for 1 or 2 but have no practice cooking for a group of 9

I screwed it up, undercooked chicken, and overcooked some steak and her dad was angry with me. I got short with him and told him that if he knew how to do better he could pitch in instead of standing around criticizing.

But he got furious and said he was on his vacation. I said that I was trying to have a vacation too, or did they invite me to be an unpaid domestic servant? 

Meg's parents and dad's friends got angry I said that and started yelling at me.

The argument escalated, I sarcastically called myself ""the help""

His dad snapped at me and told me to get out of their suite and go home. Didn't say shit about how he expected me to do that.

I left and called the airline with my ticket, and asked them if they could do anything to prevent anyone else from modifying or cancelling my ticket. They let me set a passcode, and no changes could be made to the flight without it.  

Then I went to the resort desk to ask about rooms, saying I was stranded unexpectedly. They actually did have some affordable rooms available because of a weekday discount. So I got housing and still had money left over for touristy stuff. 

I went sightseeing and relaxed on the beach for three days, until Meg's parents ran into me. They were taking a sunset walk and did a double take seeing me on the beach. They said they thought I was going home, and I said I decided to stay. They were angry because they saw me staying and using the return flight as having deceived them into thinking I couldn't afford a vacation, and using them for flights when I could actually afford things.

Judy has a visible burnscar on her forehead. It was due to an accident she was in when she was 9. She used tk be incredibly insecure about it. To the point where I was forced to home school her and it was hard trying to deal with and navigate through this rough time. Now she's doing a lot better though some comments can really cause her to become stressed out and anxious. My fiancee knows all that and respects it. Before we went to her parents house I asked her to tell them about Judy and her struggle and get to try and not say anything negative about it or possibly mention it. She said she would guarentee no one will say anything.


We got to the event and they talked to Judy and she slowly warmed up to them. Everything was going well til I was dinner time. My FMIL looked at Judy while she was eating and pointed at her scar. Basically asking questions about it which made Judy lose her appetite and start to get uncomfortable. I kept sending my fiancee and her mom signs to knock it off but to no avail. Finally, FMIL then brought up the wedding and asked my fiancee if it'd be possible to ""photoshop"" the scar out of any wedding photos that will have Judy in them just in case they distract viewers. I was dumbfounded, fiancee said nothing just stared casually while nodding. I looked at Judy and it was clear this got to her. I leaned closer and asked if she was feeling uncomfortable and that we could leave if the answer was yes. She took her time then nodded and said ""yes, I'm feeling uncomfortable right now"".I got up and told her to get ready cause we were leaving. My fiancee, her mom and the family started insisting we finish dinner and stay but I refused. I took Judy and got in the car and left before even talking to my fiance.

Obviously, she was pissed. She called an was angry talking about how I disrespected her parents by taking Judy and leaving in the middle of dinnerand not even ""saying goodbye"", i told her that Judy was feeling uncomfortable with FMILs comments and questions. She said Judy overreacted and is in need to go back to therapy if a simply mention of her scar caused her to react that way.

Hello! 

I f23 have been married to my husband m26 for a year. I'm in my last year of university and been so so busy for the last two weeks, with many projects and finals looming. My husband complains from seeing me studying and not doing activities together or hanging out with friends anymore. I've told him it's not gonna last forever and that I need to focus because this is my last year and it's been the hardest.



The day before the exam he wanted me to go with him to a friend's birthday party. I refused because I was busy preparing for my exam. he pleaded with me saying it's just one hour and talked about how his friends will be upset if I'm not there. I said no and shut down any further discussions. He got upset and called me selfish and inconsiderate but then dropped it.


Before I went to bed, I set my alarm clock like I always do since I'm a heavy sleeper+I stayed up late studying. The next morning I woke up at 9am. I literally freaked out and checked my alarm and found that it was set to go off at 9:30 am. I had no idea how this happened til my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time. I couldn't believe it I absolutely blew up at him just yelling and screaming at him left and right. He just stood there shocked from my reaction and my rage. I got dressed quickly and rushed to the university. 

They didn't let me into the exam hall. I got into a lot of hassle to get them to re-schedule the exam especially since I had no legit reason as to why I was late. It was awful is all I can say.


I went home and my husband and I stopped speaking to each other. He kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling. And that I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it but I think that my exams should be a priority and his way of ""teaching me a lesson"" was not right.","AITA for blowing up at my husband for messing with my alarm and causing me to miss my exam?

It makes me wonder what he was like 10 years ago because he sure ain't mellow now. 

It's also a small enough company that there's no HR, only the corporate management. Which didn't help. 

So I took a different approach. I stopped calling him ""angry"", or calling what he was doing ""arguing"" or ""yelling"". I just swapped in the words ""emotional"" or ""throwing a tantrum"" or ""having a fit""

I was kinda hoping if I could shift his reputation from domineering (big man vibes) to emotional and tantrumming (weak sad baby vibes) 

So I started just making subtle comments. Like if I had a meeting with him and he got a temper, I'd mention to the other people ""Wow, it's crazy how emotional Jay got. I dunno how he has the energy to throw a hissy fit at 9 am, I'm barely awake"" 

Or when my boss asked me to recap a meeting he missed, I told him ""Dan, Jack, and James had some really great feedback on my report for (this client). Jay kinda had trouble managing his emotions and had a temper tantrum again, but you know how he gets."" 

Or when a coworker asked why he was yelling I'd say ""Honestly I don't even know, he was getting so emotional about it he wasn't speaking rationally."" 

I tried to drop it in subtly and some of my coworkers started picking it up. I don't think consciously, just saying stuff like ""Oh, another of Jay's fits"" or something.

I got gutsy enough to even start saying to his face ""Hey, I can hardly understand what you're trying to explain when you're so emotional""

And again my coworkers started picking up on it and I even caught several of them telling him to get a hold of himself.

After a while, he started to get a reputation as emotional and irrational. Which I could tell pissed him off. But he stopped yelling at me as much. 

Anyway, he slipped once this week and I just said ""I really can't talk to you when you're being this emotional"" and he blew up at me asking why I was always calling him that. I shrugged and said ""dude you look like you're on the verge of tears, go look in the mirror before you ask me"" and he got really angry I suggested he might start crying. (That was a kinda flippant comment, he was red faced angry not tearful angry, and I could tell.) 

I feel like a bit of a dick for being petty and trying to gaslight this guy into thinking everyone around him sees him like a crybaby. But it also mostly worked when the ""proper channels"" didn't

(That was a kinda flippant comment, he was red faced angry not tearful angry, and I could tell.) 

I feel like a bit of a dick for being petty and trying to gaslight this guy into thinking everyone around him sees him like a crybaby. But it also mostly worked when the ""proper channels"" didn't

When I (37M) was 17 got my then-girlfriend (16) pregnant with twin boys, her parents didn’t want the babies to “ruin” her future so they said that I had to either take them or give them up for adoption because she was not raising them. I wanted to give them up but my parents told me not to. 

For the first seven years of my boys’ lives, I didn’t act like a father and was more like a big brother (They knew I was their father though, but we never bonded like father-sons) 

When I was ready to move out, I wanted to do it without them but my dad let me know it was my responsibility so I had to take them (I didn’t want it at first but I’m glad it happened) We started bonding as father-sons, I started loving them and their love for me increased I remember the three of us would seat on the couch to watch movies, one would sit on my left and one on my right while I wrapped my arms around them, they’d put their heads on my chest and I often kissed their forehead. We’ve been doing this since they were seven.

I met my current wife, 5 years ago, (my kids were 15) we married 3 years ago after we welcomed our daughter (4F), she saw me doing this with my kids when we watched movies and she never said anything. 

My kids are no longer living with us because they left for college, but they come to see me every now and then. My boys are 20 now but they still like to put their heads on my chest while I wrap my arms around them, they do it every time they visit and I’m watching TV.

My son, Liam visited me 2 weeks ago, he came out to me as gay and introduced me to his bf. I don’t care how my kids live their sexuality or who they love, I love them no matter what, I just want them to be happy and I don’t feel any different, and it doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable to hug him or kiss his forehead, but it seems that my wife is a little uncomfortable. 

My son visited me again last Wednesday (Since he was here 2 weeks ago, so the first time “officially out”) I was watching “Red” with my daughter (she was on my left) then my son Liam arrived, he was tired and sat on my right, put his head on my shoulder while I wrap my arm around him, then I kissed his forehead and said, “Good to have you back buddy”. 

We went to sleep and the next day my wife told me that It made her feel uncomfortable (me hugging and kissing my son) and asked me not to do it again while she doesn’t mind me doing it with Lucas (my other son, straight) she doesn’t want me to do it with Liam. I told her that she has no business being in my relationship with my sons, I also called her homophobic. She accused me of not treating her like an equal parent, (to my sons) thus I said ""that's  ok because you are not"" 

My brother says I should understand because this is a big “change” for her (a son coming out) but seriously think there is nothing to get “used to” this isn’t neither her nor my problem who my son loves.

He didn't say anything. He later said it was because he'd smoked weed and gets quiet and has trouble carrying on a quick conversation when he's high. But regardless I felt hurt he didn't say anything. 

I got irritated with his friends and asked ""Now why the hell would you say that when I make twice what he does?"" His friends went quiet for a second and I continued saying ""There ain't no gold to dig here, not with him or anyone at this party. So do y'all think I'm cheap, or do y'all think I'm stupid? 

My boyfriend wanted to leave the party shortly after and he was pretty upset with me for telling everyone I make twice what he does. I said I would have held my tongue if he'd checked his friends himself. But he didn't say anything so I wasn't about to let them talk to me like that.

He said it was humiliating and now everyone thinks I'm a bitch, and I flippantly said ""at least they know I'm a rich bitch""

throwaway. this whole situation is so bizarre that I still can't really process it. it still doesn’t feel real but I feel scared and guilty

I (19F) had surgery a couple days ago to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth out and because I have a really bad fear of dentists, they had to drug me pretty hard to do the removal. Not like laughing gas that wears off really fast, but actual IV medicine so I was pretty much unconscious during the whole thing. They told me to have a ""responsible adult"" drive me to the appointment and back because the meds they gave me would make it dangerous to drive. My mom was on a work trip and couldn’t take me, so I asked my sister in law Bri (24, not her real name) if she could do it as the whole thing would only take an hour or two. I even offered gas money because the dental office is about 45 minutes away. I would have asked my brother but he works during the day while bri is a stay at home mom to their 2yo daughter who I think was at bri's mom's house that day.

Bri agreed to take me to my appointment and the surgery went fine, bri waited in the lobby for me to be done. When I came out of anesthesia I was very disoriented and nauseous, which I guess is normal. I had gauze shoved in my mouth to stop any bleeding and bri took me to her car after I was let go.

I don’t really remember much of the drive but it felt like not enough time passed before bri got out of the car and told me to come with her. I was really out of it and just followed her because the alternative was staying in the hot car.

long story short, we were at a pool?? I was really confused but once we were through the gate bri basically parked me at one of those little table-benches said she'd be back in a while. I was still trying not to puke and was really dizzy from the heat (90+ degrees) and the drugs, so I asked her to take me home but she wouldn't. I guess since it was her day off and she didn’t have my niece she was meeting friends at the pool. I was starting to feel really sick and on the verge of passing out or having a panic attack, so I called my brother. I don’t think he could understand me between the meds and the stuff in my mouth because he hung up and I guess called bri because she came stomping back over, cussing and yelling at me, and took me back to the car. I passed out on the drive home, but when we arrived my brother had left work and met us in the driveway. He was screaming at bri and she was crying. I was still pretty disoriented but my brother took me back home and stayed with me until the meds wore off. That's when he told me he's divorcing bri because of what she did plus some other things he didn’t go into detail about.

It's been a few days since then and bri has been blowing up my phone telling me what a bitch I am and how me tattling destroyed her family. Part of me feels bad because of my niece and I wonder if I should've jjst dealt with it and waited for her to be done at the pool instead of calling my bro and causing problems.

Long story short at dinner they kept making jokes at my expense (I honestly would not call it bullying, just things about my height, beard, shaved head). They tried making fun of my IT job too but stopped once I told them my income. It was overall not a bad experience, but a not so pleasant one. Anyways, her older brother kept pushing things, giving me exceptional amounts of shit for playing Lacrosse in HS (apparently its a sport for prissy rich kids and not manly like football or baseball). He ended his rant by saying ""hey, we're just a big Italian family, we're loud and tell it how we see it! Hahaha!"" and all the family except my girlfriend laughed. So I, for the next minute, responded to everything they said in Italian. My girlfriend buried her head in shame, the grandfather laughed and everyone else kept looking at each other confused before telling me they didn't speak Italian. I replied ""then don't use your Italian heritage as an excuse to behave poorly when you can't even speak the language."" They got mad, but the grandfather told them all I was right and to be quiet.

Long story short at dinner they kept making jokes at my expense (I honestly would not call it bullying, just things about my height, beard, shaved head). They tried making fun of my IT job too but stopped once I told them my income. It was overall not a bad experience, but a not so pleasant one. Anyways, her older brother kept pushing things, giving me exceptional amounts of shit for playing Lacrosse in HS (apparently its a sport for prissy rich kids and not manly like football or baseball). He ended his rant by saying ""hey, we're just a big Italian family, we're loud and tell it how we see it! Hahaha!"" and all the family except my girlfriend laughed. So I, for the next minute, responded to everything they said in Italian. My girlfriend buried her head in shame, the grandfather laughed and everyone else kept looking at each other confused before telling me they didn't speak Italian. I replied ""then don't use your Italian heritage as an excuse to behave poorly when you can't even speak the language."" They got mad, but the grandfather told them all I was right and to be quiet.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend isn't mad, just ashamed, I think the grandfather likes me, but word from my gf's sister is that all the men are furious, think I'm a smart ass and that I disrespected them and their masculinity in an unforgiveable way.

My fiance (31 male) and I (25 female) are getting married soon. There wasn't much that disagreed on during the wedding planning except for food. Me and my family are vegans, and there so many reasons why we chose this lifestyle and one of them being that we have a history of health issues. My fiance and his family are the complete opposite. they're hardcore meat eaters which is fine by me obviously.

However, When deciding on the wedding food menu, I wanted to add 4-5 vegan options. My fiance and his mom objected saying it was a waste of money over food that 'isn't real food'. They also argued that this would be offensive for 'their' guests and suggested my vegan options just be ""the good ol' salads & appetizers"" (his mom wanted cupcakes lol). I said no because for one it's me and my family who's paying. and two I want to make my guests feel welcome and not be treated as second class citizens by being served ""salad"". my fiance made a face and said ""isn't that what vegans eat?"". I refused to argue about it and said it was final.


The other day, I found out that he had cancelled all the vegan options and took them off the menu completely and behind my back. I was seething. I called him at work but he kept hanging up on me. I went straight to his workplace and confronted him there and just flipped out on him. He was stunned to see me. He at first said it was his mom's idea then told me to go home because I was making a scene at the office. the fight continued at home and he defended himself by saying that I sort of made him resort to doing this after I kept brushing off his thoughs and input, and refusing to accommadate his family. but there were PLENTY of meat options why why can't I get 4-5 vegan options? when I'm paying for it?. He yelled that it was his wedding too not my family's. My family said it was fine and they'll figure it out and told me to let it go but I refused.


AITA for putting my foot down on this?

UPDATE: So his mom messaged me earlier to try to get me to listen to what she had to say after I kept ignoring her phonecalls. She spent long walls of text just to ""address"" what I did at her son's workplace, calling it all kinds of stuff from immature to unhinged. She then went to explain how she's noticed that me and my family kept ""acting dismissive"" of her son's input and ""contributations"" to the wedding. She said that she noticed my behavior towards him and her entire family and wanted to speak up earlier but didn't and tried to keep the peace. She then went on to address the food menu issue and denied her involvement in the cancellation of the vegan option but that didn't mean she doesn't support her son's decision. moreover, she thought it was soooo responsible of him to make that move because of my continual refusal to see how this stuff is waste of money. she also pointed out how I kept saying ""I paid for it"" and said that technically this isn't just my money, it's mine and *his* because we're getting married she suggested I wisen up and get rid of ""my money, I paid for it"" mentality. She finally mentioned how ""bad"" this whole situation is making me look, and said that she and her son had already offered a number of compromises that I chose to brush off and decided to make it my ""weird"" hill to die on. She said that not only her son is upset but she and ""the family"" are as well after hearing about it and suggested I just agrre on their compromise and be done with it. This pissed me off beyond belief I responded by letting her know that I'm still standing my ground on this even if I'll have to call the whole wedding off because of it because honestly? this is just ridiculous, it is!!! my mom and dad....they don't even know what to say anymore. Apparently, my fiance saw my response to her (he's with her) and is now trying to call me but right now I'm waiting on him to get home and see if he's still insisting on the stance he took.

My whole family is from a small town in Texas, a super conservative Catholic area. I was raised there, but dad got a job in NYC when I was 15. The culture shock was difficult. We went from living in rural Texas to living in an apartment in Manhattan.

My parents didn’t sell our house in TX, they allowed our aunt & uncle who just had their 3rd child to move in while charging them a small rent. 
In college when I came out as bi, my brother and dad were very supportive. My mom needed some time to accept. The rest of my family reacted poorly at first but came around. 

During visits we stayed with my aunt and uncle at my old house, but because we weren’t married we weren’t allowed to share a bed. We didn’t argue, we both would rather make peace. Visiting since, instead of staying with my aunt & uncle we would rent a motel room.

During Covid we did not visit them. But this summer, my parents and bro decided to go visit my hometown again for 2 weeks, & invited my husband and I. I wanted a motel again but my aunt & uncle insisted my brother, husband and I stay with them.

The 1st night sleeping situation was being discussed after my cousins went to bed. My aunt & uncle wanted me and bro to take the spare bedroom, husband on couch. All 3 of us took issue with that. 

They snapped that we were not really married because we were gay, & that they had children in the house. They said that it would be a bad influence on their kids. This hurt my husband’s feelings and he started crying & ran out of the room. When my husband ran out, my uncle had the audacity to start laughing. That’s when I saw red. 

I started cussing them out so loudly that my young cousins came to investigate. I told them that if they didn’t go apologize to my husband immediately then I was going to tell my dad what just happened, and I was going to make sure to have them kicked out of the house — that was still in my parents’ name.

My bro seconded everything that I was saying. They started backtracking and saying that we were still welcome in “their” house but that we had to follow their rules, I responded that it wasn’t really THEIR house. I told them they were going to be homeless if I had my way.

The kids started crying cause they heard me say they were all going to be homeless, so we left. My husband was on the porch crying, I promised him that I would never subject him to that again.

I told dad what happened. To say that my dad was angry would be an understatement. He served them a notice of eviction for 60 days. I have been getting calls and texts and Facebook messages from my family calling me AH.

I was fed up, I'd had a pretty rough day with work and I have some awfully bad associations with that word being used by other people in my life who were pretty abusive. So I was so irritated that I dropped the pot of pasta sauce I'd been carrying right on the ground and was like ""Well nothing's for dinner tonight now. And I better not hear you using that word again, it's for the girls""

He was freaking out about how sauce had landed on his rug and he even said ""you're seriously acting like a bitch right now, I dunno what else to call it""

I just walked out and got takeout for myself and went to my friends house. She thought it was funny but my boyfriend was furious, he kept texting and calling and sending me voice memos trying to explain that saying ""what's for dinner tonight b*tch"" was a TikTok trend.... And that he was just quoting something as a joke to put on tiktok. 

I thought that was the shittiest excuse ever, it doesn't matter if he saw it as a joke, or stole the ""joke"", it was still disrespectful. 

But it didn't change the fact he thought that shit was funny, to demean me when I was trying to do him a favor. Like hell I came over when he was studying to make a home cooked dinner and he decides it's time for jokes? So I put my phone on don't disturb for the night and split a bottle of wine with my friend and her roommate. 

The next morning he was sending me angry texts demanding I clean his rug because he was too busy with exams to do it. I was shocked he left it overnight, that's disgusting. I texted him back saying.

""Yeah so that's the b*tch tax honey :) leave me alone till you're ready to handle your own cooking and cleaning because this b*tch isn't anymore. Also it's vile you left that soaking in all night""

He called me and told me that he was okay with doing his own household work, but I did throw a full pot of sauce at the ground so that's on me to clean up. 

I told him ""yeah no I'm not comfortable doing chores for you if you see me like your b*tch"" 

He told me he didn't and it was just a ""trend"" and I got pissed off he was playing that ""TikTok trend"" BS excuse again and I told him ""Well I'm starting a trend called 'saucing' where as a little joke people throw pasta sauce around!

I f32 gave birth to my son 5 weeks ago. My husband's mom has been camping in the living room ever since and inviting people over, making a mess in the house, etc. I said nothing because if I open my mouth, my husband would start scolding me saying his mom is there to help and I should be grateful. What I did was ignore her and focus on my son.

I handle feeding, diaper change, cleaning, wiping. I only get a few hours sleep so my husband's mom isn't really helping with the baby. But I thought to myself ""well, at least she cooks for us!"".


Last night, I was in the bedroom breastfeeding my son. I knew I was late for dinner but I thought that my husband and his mom saved a plate for me. Once I got done with my son, I walked out the room and saw my husband and his mom sitting watching tv. I asked about dinner and my husband said it was ""probably"" on the stove. As I was walking towards the kitchen, his mom loudly said that she didn't save me any food. I was absolutely shocked I asked her why and she simply said ""Well, we didn't see you at dinner table so I thought you weren't hungry"". I lost it and yelled that I was feeding my son OF COURSE I was hungry, I was actually starving!. She shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her fault I didn't ""show up for dinner"" but she knew damn well that I was with my son and hadn't eaten a thing in hours!. My husband asked me to not raise my voice at his mom but I told him that he saw what happened and didn't think about me being hungry and needing food. he lashed out asking what the fuck I wanted him to do and I said ""I don't know, maybe save some food for me?"" She defended him saying it was selfish of me to basically berate him for eating his dinner after working for long hours at the department. An argument ensued and I went inside the bedroom, packed a small bag for me and my son, called my brother to come take me to mom's house and my husband blew up at me as I was making my way out. We argued at the door and he told me that what I was doing was uncalled for and childish. I told him I couldn't take his mom anymore, he said I should be ashamed of myself for talking about her like that after she literally put her life ""on pause"" so she could help ME out. My brother came and I got into the car and left.


He picked some food for me on the way and I ate like a hungry bear. My husband never stopped calling though. In his last text he called me ""nuts"" and demanded I return today but I said that I miss my mom, that I like it here in her clean home with her healthy food and would like to stay for a while. He's lost it and got his family involved accusing me of keeping his son away from him and punishing him over ""food"".

How long am I going to stay here??? There's no telling but at least I'm being pampered and treated like a princess by my mom, dad, brothers - heck, I couldn't get this treatment in my own home!. As for my husband, He can come over to mom's house if he wants to see his son so badly but I doubt he'll do it since he's a very prideful person and this might hurt his ego.**

His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along.


I hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this ""vision"" she has for the wedding and how it should be.


She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that ""she always pictured her son's bride in it"" mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her ""vision"" but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had ""envisioned"" myself wearing at my wedding!.


She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and ""turned down"" her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked ""what process?"" duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom.

Anyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress ""a chance"". I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a ""vision"" and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw.


Mom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and ""go with the flow"" but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?. AITA for my reaction?

His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along.


I hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this ""vision"" she has for the wedding and how it should be.


She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that ""she always pictured her son's bride in it"" mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her ""vision"" but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had ""envisioned"" myself wearing at my wedding!.


She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and ""turned down"" her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked ""what process?"" duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that ""both dresses weren't that much different anyway"" like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different.

For context, it's not that she didn't know what he wanted. She told me that she understood exactly what he was asking for, but that she was deliberately refusing because he hadn't asked correctly.

This really pissed me off, but luckily my husband came inside at that moment and pulled me away so we could calm down and settle Louis. That night at the dinner table, Sarah asked me to pass her something, but she said it in ""bad"" English (she IS English, I just mean that she asked for it in slang.

I (F35) am infertile. My ex husband and I tried everything to have kids but it just never happened. He divorced me, went and married someone younger who was able to give him a kid and from what I gather, they're expecting a 2nd child together. It hurts like hell seeing someone else have what I couldn't. I get frustrated with myself sometimes and with family blaming me for basically everything. I turn to my friends for support, Especially ""Alessia"", she's in the same ""infertility boat"" as me but she and her husband are currently trying IVF hoping it'd work.


Alessia asked me for help to pay for her upcoming IVF cycle. I agreed to write her a check of $12,000, I really wanted to help her and the money came with no strings attached. I wrote the check and gave it to her last week. She was very appreciative of it.


The very next day, I got a sudden message from a mutual friend ""Carol"" with a screenshot of the conversation she had with Alessia. Turns out she and Alessia were talking about the next IVF cycle, and Alessia said she hoped the cycle would work because ""she didn't wanna end up divorced, and having her husband go marry someone younger and have a baby with them and another one on the way! While she's alone and without a family at 35! (She's 32). I was stunned and...hurt, I knew she meant me here. But I did not confront her I simply contacted my bank and cancelled the check. In the evening, Alessia called to ask why I cancelled the check and I told her. She went batshit saying she didn't mean it that way and that she thought that this was somewhat an ""inside joke"" between ""desperate infertile women"". She came over with her husband the next day begging I write another check but I refused. An argument ensued and her husband thought I wasn't being supportive of her like when she supported me throughtout my struggles. She left crying and we haven't talked since then. Her husband keeps reminding me (while repeatedly calling Carol a toxic snake) of the date of the next cycle saying they can't have it after I took the money that was supposed to pay for it back!.


Some friends thinks I'm being oversensitive. Carol's on my side telling me to tell them to go to hell but I feel so bad about it. what I've done might just damage our 15 years of friendship. Maybe I shouldn't have cancelled it but I just felt so offended by what she said about me and how she basically mocked my unfortunate circumstances.

It's a shame having to come to the realization that even those who are supportive of you the most, could cause as much harm.

I (32f) have been with my wife Ava (34f) for 8 years now, but we’ve been married for 5. She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 & 12) and a son (now 16). I’ve watched these kids grow up, I’ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they’ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now.

My brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fiancé Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there’s never been a moment where the kids and my wife were treated like they didn’t belong.
My brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop— the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them.

The kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.
Ivan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her.

My kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn’t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too.

Sara spoke up and said “oh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.”

My dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn’t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they’d say that my kids weren’t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn’t be their grandchildren because they weren’t really my children.

My wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn’t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their “real” family while I spent the holiday with mine.

I left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA.

My brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren’t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn’t want this to ruin my niece’s first thanksgiving.

I haven’t replied back. I meant what I said, but I’m worried that maybe I’m reacting too harshly.

ETA INFO:

I adopted all three of the kids about 4 years ago, so they aren't just my parents ""step grandchildren"". Even if I hadn't legally adopted them, they'd still be my kids in my eyes.

Edit no.2:

- My wife's parents don't have a relationship with the kids. When my wife came out, they pretty much stopped speaking with her entirely.
- Their bio dad is not involved and neither is his family. He lost his rights to the children before Ava and I started dating. The 10yo has never met him, the 12yo doesn't remember him, and the 16yo wants nothing to do with him.
- My parents wanted the kids to call them Nana and Pop. I didn't make the kids start calling them that.","AITA for canceling the plans for thanksgiving after my parents called my brother’s baby their “first grandchild”?[update](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawayz_12345/comments/yy9a7e/update_on_canceling_the_plans_for_thanksgiving/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 & 12) and a son (now 16). I’ve watched these kids grow up, I’ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they’ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now.

My brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fiancé Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there’s never been a moment where the kids and my wife were treated like they didn’t belong.
My brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop— the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them.

The kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.
Ivan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her.

My kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn’t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too.

Sara spoke up and said “oh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.”

My dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn’t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they’d say that my kids weren’t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn’t be their grandchildren because they weren’t really my children.

My wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn’t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their “real” family while I spent the holiday with mine.

I left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA.

My brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren’t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn’t want this to ruin my niece’s first thanksgiving.

I haven’t replied back. I meant what I said, but I’m worried that maybe I’m reacting too harshly.

ETA INFO:

I adopted all three of the kids about 4 years ago, so they aren't just my parents ""step grandchildren"". Even if I hadn't legally adopted them, they'd still be my kids in my eyes.

Edit no.2:

- My wife's parents don't have a relationship with the kids. When my wife came out, they pretty much stopped speaking with her entirely.
- Their bio dad is not involved and neither is his family. He lost his rights to the children before Ava and I started dating. The 10yo has never met him, the 12yo doesn't remember him, and the 16yo wants nothing to do with him.
- My parents wanted the kids to call them Nana and Pop.

When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.

We didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.

So my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. 

Anyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.

I visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is £500k and she needs a £150k deposit. She has £100k so far. £25k on her own, £25k from her mum and £50k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra £50k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.

I said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave £10k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back ""like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?""

Everyone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either.

My mum later told me I could have turned him down without being an asshole or bringing up childhood which he already feels guilty about.

She'd barge in, then turns and says ""oh sorry"" then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said ""so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!"". He seriously said that!.


We have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5.

When she ""accidently"" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position.

My fiancee (F) and I (M) are getting married. We've decided wedding's gonna be childfree. No hate towards children just to keep it more organized and contained.


My brother 'Chris' (M) and his wife (F) have a 3 yro son who everyone calls ""miracle"" or ""rainbow"" baby. He came after several failed pregnancies that lasted for years. 

When they found out that my nephew was included in the no children rule; they tried to convince me to make an exception for him. Chris told me his son is a miracle baby and his presence at the wedding will bring ""blessings"" for me and my fiancee. I refused and said no, the wedding is childfree.

He asked again and pointed out how his baby is different since he's a rainbow, a miracle baby. I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. They brought it up when they visited at my home and I knew they weren't going to stop so I'd made flash cards in advance with the phrase ""the wedding is childfree, period"" and pulled them out and started slowly showing them the flash cards one by one in this order: 

- The wedding (with a sticker of bride and groom). 

- Is Child (with a sticker of a baby). 

- FREEE (with a sticker of a 🚫 sign). 

- PERIOD (with a huge, black dot sticker). 

They both were stunned. I asked if they get it now and Chris had lost his shit. His wife had already grabbed her stuff and walked out. Chris called me an asshole for doing this and said that I disrespected him, his wife and their son who's my one and only nephew. He rushed out after we argued.

- called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute

- bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere 

- google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management 

- got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors

- every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my ""client"" at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue. 

- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. 

Well, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. 

Well, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. 

But then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. 

He started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.

He told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. 

I was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? 

I was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks.

- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. 

Well, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. 

Well, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. 

But then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. 

He started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.

He told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. 

I was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? 

I was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks.

It is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin.  I don't really care.  I'm an adult and I do what I want.  We are getting married in June.  

So we are visiting my parents for Christmas. The way it came together this year everyone is at my parents house.  So that's my folks, my three siblings, myself and fiancee, and seven grandchildren.  So seventeen people.  

At dinner my mom starts going on about how she is so glad that we are finally getting married and she won't be embarrassed at church any more.  And my dad says how proud he is of his three older kids who all either waited to get married before moving in together or got married right away after moving in together.

I already know my brother was over 9 pounds and almost 23"" long when he was born.  My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me. 

The subject gets changed very fast.  After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married.

Every Christmas is special for Andy, his bd is on Dec/24.  His dad started a tradition where Santa would've consideration with him for being a ""kid of Christmas"". So he feels magical and special. I always try to give him that. Last year, i left ""Santa Claus"" footsteps, ate a carrot and ""grass"" he left for Rudolf. Stuff like that.

My husband doesn't think it's a good idea i do all that for him, and I'm showing favoritism.

At first, it was cute to see them spy on Bob, try to see it ""fly"" each night. Andy was the most excited of all, i found him one night talking with it, asking it if Santa still remembered him.

But my husband took seriously the ""Behave or Bob would be naughty"" part. Lucas was his first victim after he didn't do his chores. The next day, his face was drawn with sharpie markers.

I talked to him about how we should lower the pranks, he agreed but wanted to catch Andy since he hadn't break any rules. I told him that Bob's supposed to tell Santa instead of being naughty. We argued but he finally agreed.

Fast forward, it's Christmas Eve and in the afternoon we had some of Andy's friends to celebrate his bd. So the kids were playing in backyard. But my husband looked sus. I decided to look for Bob. It was supposed to be in the kitchen but it wasn't there, I asked Miles where it was and he told me ""no idea"". I started getting paranoid, but Andy asked me if we could cut the cake already. I put my best face on and went for it. The cake was in a box, and when Andy opened the box. He starts crying. I take a look and it's ruined. ""Bob"" was covered in all of it, appearing he had been eating the cake. Half of the cake wasn't there anymore. Miles starts laughing and so did some of the other parents.

My blood is boiling and i grab Bob and throw it in the trash, Then i grabbed Miles. We have a terrible argument, calls me an AH for what i did to Bob, that I've ruined it, how are we supposed to keep the ""magic"" with our kids if i wasn't supposed to touch Bob.

I f32 recently inherited a good amount of money from my mom. I keep the money in a seperate account as I still haven't decided what to do with it and I didn't want it to go to waste.


I noticed my husband constantly bringing up the inheritance money and making countless suggestions as to how I should spend it. Another thing is that he expects me pay for nearly everything the past couple of weeks.

My husband's mom joked about paying for dinner out of my "" inheritance pocket"" which made me livid but I showed no reaction. Just silently paid for my own food/drinks.

He got back at 3 a.m yeling at me saying I was pathetic to get up and walk out on him and his family after they *relied* on me to pay for their food and thougt I was gracious enough to do it BUT they were wrong. He said I humiliated him and family and that what I did was an attempt to get back at them for not being able to help mom when she was sick. Not true is all I'm gonna say.

My son ""Aiden"" (23) moved back in with us upon graduating college as my husband wanted. My husband's original plan was to have Aiden live with us for free, but stay home and help with his disabled younger brother (16). Aident started complaining about needing money and wanted to find a job. My husband was against this and even offered to double his allowance but Aiden was growing tired of staying at home.


So he began looking for jobs here and there for over a year but non of his job applications came through. He'd just apply and they never get back to him. We were confused by this til recently, I found out that my husband was behind all the job applications being cancelled. He'd wait tol Aiden applies then he proceeds to cancel the application by impersonating him and using his email. I blew up at him for this but his justification is that he's just trying to make sure that our younger son is cared for by Aiden and said that Aiden has been big help and him getting a job will affect his care for his brother. I went ahead and rented an apartment for Aiden and told him to stay there til he finds a job and starts paying for it himself. Aiden was hurt upon knowing what his dad did. My husband was livid when he found out. He called me unhinged and said that I was separating the boys and teaching Aiden to become selfish and care more about a job than family. He also said it was huge decision for me to rent an apartment without even running it with him.


He's been giving me hell about it and is calling me a terrible mother for encouraging Aiden to be selfish and selfcentered. He said I needed to see and understand why he did what he did.

(1) My husband says that since he and I have health issues then we could use Aiden's help.

(2) When I suggested outside help, my husband refused saying he won't ask anything from anybody and that his son is his problem and no body else's.

I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind. 

I'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online. 

Sometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.
My fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them. 

Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down. 

My fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me. 

I grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise.

So here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation.

But in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that.

In the country I live in it's currently winter, and we get a fair amount of snow so my wedding was a winter themed wedding. The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOH""s dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories. 

I have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice.

She said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more ""girly"". I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOH""s dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black. 

I paid for all the dresses. 

Fast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool.

So fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation. 

I confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend. 

The wedding went on and it was truly amazing.

Ever since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that.

She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool.

So fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation. 

I confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend. 

The wedding went on and it was truly amazing.

Ever since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back.

I was super excited because I love music. Over time I kind of became known as the 'piano guy' at school. I play at school concerts, accompany the school jazz choir, and play once a week for the residents at a couple of retirement homes in our town.

When I was 15, I started to talk about quitting lessons, and my parents quickly tried to guilt me out of it. I told them I wanted to try other things, and that between piano and studying, I didn't have much time left for other extra curriculars. My Dad proposed a deal. If I kept playing and taking lessons until I reached level 10 RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music), and continued to keep my grades up at school, he would buy me a new car of my choice. I jumped at it and we shook hands on the deal.

I should explain that my family is well off financially. I have a very privileged life, but I wouldn't say I've been spoiled. If I ever want a luxury item like a new phone or game console, I have to buy it myself with money I've saved from summer and after school jobs.

I should also explain that my Dad's big on loopholes.  When we compete, he always finds a way to win, and when I do it doesn't count because of some loophole. It drives me nuts, but he thinks it's hilarious.  Whenever I complain about him not playing fair, his answer is always the same: life isn't fair.

So, because of our deal, I kept up with my lessons. I spent about 1-2 hours a day on piano, while keeping my grades up. Last summer, I took my level 9 RCM exams and passed, fulfilling my part of the deal. II told my Dad I'd chosen the BMW X5 plug-in hybrid SUV.

A couple of months ago, on my birthday, I came downstairs for breakfast, and my Dad told me there was a surprise waiting for me in the garage. I ran out, and sitting in the middle of the floor was a 1/24 scale, toy BMW X5. My Dad burst out laughing and said, ""A deal's a deal, so as promised here is your brand new BMW!"" My heart absolutely broke. I asked if he was being serious, and he said I couldn't seriously have expected him to buy a 17 year old a real brand new BMW and that we could discuss getting me a reasonably priced used car. I said we had a deal and I fulfilled my end of it, he said he did too since I never said that the car had to be full size and drivable. I said he wasn't being fair. His response: life isn't fair.

Ever since this happened, I've been distant with my Dad. I honestly feel like he betrayed my trust and that he deliberately made a fool out of me. He keeps bringing up the idea of a used car, but I told him I'm not interested, which I admit is kind of petty. I have enough money saved that I can buy a cheap used car myself, and I just feel like if I accept one from him now it's like saying that breaking his promise didn't matter and that he didn't do anything wrong.

I fell asleep for 4 hrs. I woke up and went to get a drink of water. I couldn't every glass we own is scattered around the house. They didnt clean a single thing. I passive aggressively started to pick up the dirty dishes and washed them.

The following morning. I was trying my best to work when their kids were crying non stop. Banging on the walls so on. Their mom was in her room for hours ignoring them.  

When my husband came home. He was upset with me over how I didn't make his brother's wife feel welcome in our home. By helping with their kids when she was tired. Then continued to complain how nothing was done while he was at work all day in the house. Yep the same one he didn't clean.

That lead to a fight where I told him. ""I am too sick to have company and they need to leave"".  To which he replied they are his family and he won't kick them out. I started to cry again.  I was beyond frustrated, exhausted, I physically couldnt do it anymore. I called my mom asking if I could come stay with her. Telling her the whole story infront of my husband.

At 19 he married a girl he met, I tried convincing him to wait because I personally felt he was too immature. They both dropped out and moved back here to his home town. At 20 they had their first child, a beautiful little girl. 16 months later, my DIL gave birth to their second child, a little boy. 

After the first baby, my wife and I noticed our DIL wasn’t happy. We both thought it was PPD related. Just after the second arrived, my son and his wife separated. She would bring the kids over for a visit, it was then she began unloading on us. I know there’s two sides to every story, but considering I know my son, I believed her. I sat my son down numerous times to speak with him regarding his marriage. He refused to take responsibility, blamed her for everything even when I directly pointed out where he was the sole problem. 

They got into counseling, for a year things were ‘ok’ on the surface. Our DIL filed for divorce, my son 3 days later was on Facebook announcing his new girlfriend. A month later, they were engaged. My son had forced his then wife to become a permanent SAHM at the birth of their first child. She of course had no other family or friends here, she knew no one aside from us. She had nowhere to go with two small children. Unbeknownst to our son, my wife and I helped her financially and got her an apartment. 

Before the divorce was even finalized, we received a wedding invitation. I made it clear to my son, I would not be attending and they would not have my blessing. His mother told him she would see to it that I would attend. I stayed consistent in my decision, I also asked him not to bring his fiancée around our house out of respect for the mother of his children. 

The wedding happened on Feb 11. The night before, my wife gave me the finial push. I did not attend. Our daughter, also did not attend for the same reasons. My wife picked up our grandkids, got them dressed and attended the wedding. My daughter and I decided to spend the evening with his ex. I couldn’t imagine her sitting alone, while her kid’s attended their father’s wedding. 

She was taken aback that I didn’t end up attending his wedding. We took her out to distract her mind. I just wanted her to know, she’ll always be considered family to us. My daughter also made a joke they can drop the in-law status and just be sisters now. She was very tearfully grateful, I realized just how badly she needed our support and specifically on that night. 

The next morning, my son called to tell me how much of a horrible father I am for not attending his wedding. Few days later he caught wind that I spent the wedding evening with his ex. He said that was the ultimate form of betrayal, and further myself and his sister would have to earn an relationship with him on his terms only.


*****ETA: First, I’d like to sincerely thank each and everyone of you for your support, encouragement, and all the awards. I know without a doubt, I did the right thing. I even feel differently now, his mother should not have attended either. But we can’t go back and undo that. 

So, my son saw the post. I had sent my daughter the link yesterday so she could read the comments. This morning she texts me at work…DAD YOU WENT VIRAL! Lol But anyways, he sent screenshots of the post and all my comments to his mom. He also told her…”He’s dead to me now.” Time will tell if he means that. I’m sure he’ll see this update too. For that reason, I’m positively certain the second he needs another cash loan I won’t be dead anymore. 

His mom told him, “Your children have to be our number one priority.” They’re not just some disposable items you can leave behind when one chapter of your life closes. Maybe one day, he’ll understand this.","AITA?

The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly. 

At first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too. 

The problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no. 

There are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made. 

She called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day. 

I don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind. So AITA?


UPDATE: 

first I would like to thank all the comments and suggestions, I really didn't expect my post to resonate so much. 

I talked to my son about the suggestions you guys gave me and he agreed to sell the dress at market price. He calculated the price of everything and the value was quite high. We sent the proposal to my sister and she hated it. She said she couldn't afford it because it was too expensive and it should be a gift because ""she is family"". I responded by saying that it was too easy to say she was family to get a free dress, but not enough to include my son. She cried on the call and begged me not to ruin her day, but I didn't call because that to me was bullshit. 

At no point did she offer to just let my son go or apologize for it. 

And for anyone who said that maybe she's homophobic, I'm not sure, but I think who could be influencing her is her fiancé who is a Christian and has never been close to my son. However, I don't care if he's doing it or not. If she wants to exclude my son from this event then she will also be cutting ties with me. 

And for those who are asking for a photo of the dress, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my son didn't agree and unfortunately I won't post it because of that.

A week ago I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting as a celebration for her getting engaged. I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn’t. I’m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices.

I didn’t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun.

After ten minutes my friend’s fiancé walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same.

He asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn’t know this was the wedding.

I trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me.

I assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn’t bother her after that and the party soon ended.

I got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did.

That only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine.

She didn’t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it’s my fault that the two are now fighting over this.

I’ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn’t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything.

So, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding?

After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant. 

Since having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH. 

Anyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl.

Now my fiancé (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes. 

So I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6.

She then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter.

She then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should ""honor her"" in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece. 

Now I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said 

""Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her?""

She started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm ""letting her down"". I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway. 

Well now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece.

I'm firm in my decision though, and my fiancé is thankful that I didn't let his daughter down. AITA for not allowing my niece to be the flower girl?","AITA for not letting my miracle baby niece be my flower girl at my wedding?My (27F) older brother and SIL (both mid 30's) just welcomed their first child a year and a half ago, after YEARS of trying. After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant. 

Since having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH. 

Anyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl.

Now my fiancé (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes. 

So I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6.

She then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter.

She then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should ""honor her"" in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece. 

Now I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said 

""Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her?""

She started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm ""letting her down"". I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway. 

Well now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece.

A lot of people wanted an update I wanted to see my roommate in a more positive light. I tend to try to see the best in people but reading the replies and his recent actions have opened my eyes. I never took him too seriously because he's a pretty harmless little guy in my perspective. There is a big difference in how he lashes out at me compared to his gf. He's gotten big tough with me in text form but only mildly upset when I see him in person. I have taken a step back and looked at anything I could have done to provoke him(not excusing his behavior) And while I don't believe I am in the wrong for being hospital and hosting a guest. If a 75 year old man we're staying with us. I would treat him the same as I have treated his gf.  
  
  
  
  
  
I do realize that he is not from the south. I was told by others in school that women outside the south don't enjoy being called ""ma'am."" however, I've never seen a lady get angry if I did call her ma'am up here. I call women of all ages ""dear"" or ""darling"" and I could see how that could be seen as flirtatious even though it's just part of how I speak. Now that he knows I have seen him in his ""true form"" he doesn't even try to act the way he did before. I sent his gf screenshots of the texts he's sent and told her the things he's said. I'm not sure if she is leaving or staying but I've let her know and told her to let me know if she needs any help. I don't plan on moving any time soon as I enjoy having room for a grill and smoker and a garage. He told me he's looking for new places to live and will potentially go back to his parents.

I am flattered and overwhelmed by all the positive replies. Bout a hundred of you told me to thank my mom so I sure will. I grew up working in hospitality with my mom and siblings. My dad is the one that instilled respect into me. He never felt emasculated even when my mom's business ended up making more than he does. They just save their money from their jobs and go on vacation a lot. Thank you for all the kindness and offers for adoption/jobs/relationships/friendships lol.

I(21m) am from the south. I grew up in New Orleans and Texas. My mom runs a catering business and the majority of clients were either at home in Louisiana or in Texas. I add this to say that I grew up cooking and helping my mom cook for the business. I was frying chicken and catfish when I could reach the stove and making gumbo and buttermilk biscuits at a very young. I'm currently in culinary school right now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've lived in a rented house on the east coast with my roommate(22m) for a year and a half. He's not a friend or anything. We just linked up because we both needed roommates in the area. He's good to live with and we watch shows and movies together. We hang out and go out for drinks sometimes. I always make friends easy because of being from the south and doing customer service related things since I was a kid. I know how to talk and charm and listen to folk despite being naturally more in the introverted spectrum. My roommate has been seeing his girlfriend(20m) for like 6 months. I've met her before and seen her in passing. Roommate and his gf had a 2 week break from school things. She still lives at her parents so she decided to stay here the whole two weeks.  I was just doing things as I would normally do. It got weird at first when I was about to go mow the lawn and the roommate stopped me and said he wanted to mow(I usually always mow.) A couple of days later I was outside washing my car. I asked both of them if they wanted me to do theirs. She looked like she was going to agree but he looked at her angrily so they declined.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I cook pretty frequently at home as well and usually let my roommate have some. So any time I'd make some I would say that they could have some and this would get him pissed. Weeks prior when she was here and we were all talking. She mentioned this specific kind of cheesecake that she really likes. So I made and sent out a group text that everyone could have it. My roommate got upset. I don't see anything as overstepping a boundary as this is how I treat him and all guests. The other day he told me how annoying it was to hear his gf talk about ""how good your roommate can fresh baked bread is."" I'm not trying to make him look bad or anything. This is simply how i was raised. If I bake two loaves of bread I'm gonna leave it out for the house to eat.

&#x200B;

EDIT- The cheesecake is just common courtesy type thing to me. When his parents come over i make pound cake because they like it. If a guest is coming you get/make what they like. Nothing odd about picking up their favorite chips or making some tea when guests arrive. Just how I was raised

&#x200B;

EDIT- Wow this has blown up. Just want to say we generally have a good roommate relationship. We're not best friends but it's friendly enough. The only change has been when his gf is here. So lol no I am not looking to for new roommates/to be adopted/or to move but thanks. Here is some more things that upset him.

&#x200B;

I went to the grocery store and asked if anyone needed anything

&#x200B;

I was frying chicken and offered the first/best pieces out the oil to them

&#x200B;

I changed the oil to my own car

&#x200B;

I used a smoker in the backyard to make brisket

&#x200B;

I grill and smoke in the backyard and needed a piece of wood cut into a certain way to hold something up. I cut and nailed some wood together in the garage.

&#x200B;

Feels like I can't even exist while she is here

&#x200B;

FINAL EDIT- I tend to see the good and best in people. So I was not seeing him as being very insecure and was trying to look at this in a more positive light. But he just texted me and said that I  greet his gf in too kind of a way and it's annoying that I say ""be safe"" when she leaves the house(I say this to him and everyone when they they tell me they are going somewhere). He sent me a long text detailing it's bad that I look her in the eyes when she is talking to me??? Maybe it is time for a new roommate

This happened last night but my phone is still blowing up. 

I F(26) dipped into my savings and got Mike, my boyfriend (27) a PS5 for his birthday yesterday. 

He knew he was getting the PS5 because he told me that the PS5 is the only thing he wants. We’ve been together for 4 years so the cost didn’t matter. That is until, I found out what he thinks about me. 

Some background: When I was 18, I was involved with Jake, a guy who I met online. We ended things after 3 months, and I moved on shortly after with Adam, a guy from work. 

I found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didn’t know Jake long enough to meet his friend group, so I had no idea. 

After finding out, I took some time off dating and two years later, I met my current boyfriend Mike.

I was upfront and honest with Mike about my past and the fact that I was unintentionally involved with friends. He said he understood and my past didn’t bother him.

Last night at his party, I showed up with the PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy.

His best female friend Jessica laughed and said “I wish I was a thot so I could afford a PS5 too.”

I looked at her with an “excuse me?” Look on my face and she just said “nevermind” and walked away. 

I confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote “she’s just messing with you. You can’t take a joke?”

So I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said “well, everyone knows you were a thot before you met me.” 

I asked him to explain how I was a thot before him and he said “you know…messing with best friends?” 

He then pat me on the shoulder and said that it’s okay because I’m not who I was back then and if he could get over my “colourful past” and “thot mentalities” to give me a chance, then I could get over Jessica’s comments and give her another chance.

I didn’t say anything. I just got up. Took the PS5 from the gift table and left.

He was PISSED. He literally called me like 20 times, but I didn’t care. I was so hurt that I took the bow off and took it straight back to the store I got it from. They happily refunded it.

I thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica are berating me for being petty and they’re all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices. 

I responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasn’t a “thot” and get the PS5 from them because I returned it. 

He started screaming how I’m “the biggest AH” for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my “colourful past.” 

I’m thinking maybe taking it back went too far.

I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring.

This year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the ""Buts"" started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year.

My parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too.

Now my sister is not speaking to me, and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace. I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in? I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help.

Edit: It's barely been an hour since I posted. But my sister is apparently a reddit lurker in the mornings, and she saw my post. Not only is she furious with me. But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets. And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved. I'm expecting a call from them any minute.

Update: Well I'm off work now, so I can tell more of what went down. I guess you could say it's over. My sister got our parents involved, they looked at my post, and were absolutely horrified by the continuous influx of commenters. Yes they're very angry with me that I posted here. But I told them that if they'd just listened to me to begin with, I'd have never needed to. I'm sick of the whole keep the peace mentality that sacrifices me to placate my sister. They in turn went off on my sister, and to make a long story short the whole vacation has been canceled. The hotel wasn't booked yet anyway. But my parents are arguing with my sister, my sister is blaming me, and my nephews are crying because they aren't going to the beach. My sister called me at lunch and basically implied I have no life, which is why I have time to help. I recorded that and told our parents, and that's currently what they're fighting about.

Smol Update: I wasn't gonna update again. But here's a little more. Parents said that they won't ever push babysitting of my nephews on me again, and have agreed that what happened last year was unfair to me. Right now they're VERY angry with my sister for telling me I should help her because she thinks I have no life. My sister is playing the victim. And my brother in law is basically saying ""Nope!"" to the whole mess and spending most of his time at work.

I said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding.

So, I'm getting married to my fiance soon. I bought my wedding dress weeks ago. His my (FMIL) kept pestering me about trying it on but I firmly refused. I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her ""love"" for wedding dresses and her obsession with them.


Fast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the whole family the photo. She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at me. and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that as if she was an enemy. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then.

I felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard .to get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well.


AITA?


Update: Oh My God! This blew up, and so I thought I'd add some updates. My fiance called and offered to pay for the dress himself so we can ""end the conflict"" but he wants me to :

* hand him my phone so he can delete the photo himself.
* Swear that I don't have any copies to ""use"" against his mom later.
* Apologize to his mom.
* And lastly, He asked that I quit his family group chat and log out of facebook for at least a month.

I haven't responded yet.

P.s He called with this offer/conditions hours ago but I didn't want to include this in the post but now I did. Also, I'm not sure if I'll agree because I don't want him to pay for it, I want his mom, the one who wore it to pay for it.

I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her ""love"" for wedding dresses and her obsession with them.


Fast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the whole family the photo. She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at me. and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that as if she was an enemy. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then.

I felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard .to get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well.


AITA?


Update: Oh My God! This blew up, and so I thought I'd add some updates. My fiance called and offered to pay for the dress himself so we can ""end the conflict"" but he wants me to :

* hand him my phone so he can delete the photo himself.
* Swear that I don't have any copies to ""use"" against his mom later.
* Apologize to his mom.
* And lastly, He asked that I quit his family group chat and log out of facebook for at least a month.

I haven't responded yet.

P.s He called with this offer/conditions hours ago but I didn't want to include this in the post but now I did. Also, I'm not sure if I'll agree because I don't want him to pay for it, I want his mom, the one who wore it to pay for it.

As we've grown wealthier, I've learned that people become nosier. Friends, acquaintances, relatives, you name it. In the beginning I would entertain the nosy questions, but since I turned 30, I've adopted a ""take no shit"" attitude. When people ask me how much he makes, I no longer say anything. I've learned the hard way that giving an exact number can have bad consequences.

My co-worker, 25, is new and she already has quite the reputation. Very chatty, catty, gossipy, you get the gist. You can just tell she craves wealth and status. She wears a bunch of flashy designer items and is always asking the ladies around the office which of the men are single.

Last Friday, our office hosted an afternoon happy hour. She approached me and asked how me and my husband's recent vacation to Europe went. I told her it went well and briefly summarized what we did. Then the conversation went something like this:

Her: ""So what does your husband do?""

Me: ""He works in finance.""

Her: ""Oh wow, he must make a ton then to be taking you on all these lavish vacations! I hope you don't mind me asking, but how much does he make in a year??""

Me: ""Yes, we're very lucky that he makes a good salary."" *Polite smile*

Her: ""Oh c'monnn I won't tell anyone. How much does he rake in a year? Millions??""

Me: *Awkward chuckle* ""I'd rather not say, but it's up there!""

Her: ""What, he doesn't allow you to give an exact number or something??""

Me: *Visibly annoyed* ""No, I just prefer not to say.""

Her: *Laughs in my face* ""You'd think the stuck-up one would be the one with money, not the one without!""

Me: ""You should learn how to take 'no' for an answer and when to quit being a nosy bitch. It's a valuable lesson.""

Then I smiled at her and walked away. Later on, I had a few co-workers reach out to me and say that she was crying and left early and that I should apologize for calling her a rude name. I refused. I told my mom and she said I was too rude to the new girl and that she's young and might not fully understand ""salary talk"". I think she's old enough.

I told him the reason the village doesn’t exist to raise his kids is due to him burning that village down. He called me a jerk and hung up.
My husband is iffy on the situation but told me it’s my call since I would be the one to watch the kids most of the time since he travels often for work.
